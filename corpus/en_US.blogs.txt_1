Cranking up this Undead CD during my lengthy moment of social impoliteness was the perfect Metal prescription for me. Hell, if they didn’t want you to play CD’s loud in a car, then they should equip stereos to not exceed the “number 4″ on volume. So let it be Metal written, so let it be Metal told. Now, onward with this primo Death Metal album and I’m gonna tell you just how ecstatic I am about it.
That afternoon, my friends and I had a break and decided to bundle up and take a walk. We head upstairs to get our shoes and sweaters and jackets from the bedroom area. I don't have a good spot to sit down so I say that I'm going out to the main room to put on my shoes. This is a room with couches and you have to pass through this area to get to the dorm area.
My broccoli is all done and I tore it out. What do I put there?

So, on the left side you will find the traditional carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and pineapple. It will betopped with a white chocolate disc painted like a cross section of a carrot. On the left is the modern treatment of carrot cake. We have taken the flavors of carrot cake; cream cheese, carrots, pineapple, coconut and pecans and have featured them in non traditional ways. The base is a cream cheese semifreddo, on that sits a carrot mousse and a quenelle of carrot sherbet and is topped with a carrot tuile. The modern treatment sits on a sea of pineapple foam with diced pineapple relish, toasted coconuts and candied pecans. Wow, I hope all that gets done and plated in time.

My stop first stop of the trip was at the Fountain Valley School, a small campus with a very long driveway and a very cool, laid back feel to it. In true Western tradition, many of the buildings are adobe and owe a great deal to a Spanish influence. (Meals – and warm, homemade cookies! – are served each day in the Hacienda Dining Room – need I say more?)
First, you ought to work out the annual budget for your project. Your budget may, of course, decrease or increase in subsequent years. You can determine your budget in any number of ways. You might set a figure which is a percentage of your disposable income after essential bills, savings and investment. If you are the kind of person who keeps receipts, you might, alternatively, work out how much you spent last year on clothing and use this as a guide. It might be, of course, that you already have a very detailed household budget which includes a figure for your clothing. In which case let’s move on.
BBC Scotland is reporting:

However I am certain that this will not be the last story of its sort. Birds have told me that an edict has gone out from the coalition headquarters to friendly editors that UKIP must be hit hard. So I expect that in the next couple of weeks we will see a few more stories like this, dredged up, polished and presented to the public.
Happy Easter! I hope everyone has enjoyed time with family or friends. Today I’m reflecting on how blessed our lives are. Each and every day we get the opportunity to care for and experience God’s creation. He gave us our land, our animals and each other. He challenges us, too, but I often remind myself that God won’t give us more than we can handle.

We were driving last week into a colder climate where I saw a small pond with ice starting to spin its tentacles along the water. Soon the ice will win the day and the water will retreat into hibernation. We had just watched a movie about a man falling into an icy river. He tried valiantly to pull himself up on the ice pads floating on the river. The harder he tried to heave himself up; the faster the ice would break into pieces. Eventually the man gave up and swam for the shore. Luckily, he made it to safety.

Tony swears by Christopher Vogler’s The Writer’s Journey (subtitled Mythic Structure for Storytellers and Screenwriters) which, taking its cue from Campbell, examines how the hero’s journey model is used in modern writing. “I use that structure in all my stories and I do a lot of stories for five to eight year olds.”

I am Worthy of Abundance. This does not lead to a “me, first” attitude, doing down others, necessarily: I am one worthy spiritual being among others. It prompts me properly to look after myself. I have taken so much in about my wrongness, so much false shame, and it does no good to me or anyone else.

Their books contain poetry, thought, essays, interviews, recipes, art, stories, histories, futures, all beautifully written. I was honoured to be asked to paint the skin of this endeavour. It's an important and resonant thing, and I urge you to buy a copy for yourself. It also coincides with and celebrates the 200th anniversary of the Luddite rebellion. Throughout the book, there's a focus on an honest acceptance of death, and a hopeful forward-looking, there's earthiness and lyricism. And who could not cheer on a project that promises to write with dirt under its fingernails?
How secure is that God-given life? It is as secure as the giver. The sequence is outlined in Ephesians 1:13.

I fell in love with Tasmania, I truly did. So much of it is still untouched, there are still vast rolling properties and a world heritage area on this tiny island. I want a house here – a quiet escape, a beautiful view, lots of land and no TV. We fantasised the whole trip about buying 20 acres of rolling pasture by the ocean, and putting a caravan on it, until we had enough money, where the house I was already designing in my head could be built. And then I found it! While browsing HabitusLiving.com, I found somebody had built my dream house in my dream

I haven't a little portable knit since the Hitchhiker, well socks are ok I suppose but a bit awkward to work on whilst chatting to that stranger across the seat who wants to tell you what a great knitter his/her mum was, and how they wished they'd learned, and is it cheaper to knit your own? Yeah right,you'd better stck to just wishing you knit then........
I reached the familiar door and slipped inside. He lay on his simple pallet beneath the window casement, but his eyes were open in the moonlight. They sparkled like dew on the grass, as did the sweat that dampened his hairline. His hand lay against his cheek, searching for the phantom wound.

The objector in the video who claims their artwork would be changed if someone painted over a spot, is wrong. The original is not painted over, a digital copy is modified. It’s not the same as buying the Mona Lisa, and painting a mustache on it. It’d be like buying the Mona Lisa, photographing it and printing another, then modifying that one.

Looking into the eyes of your nursling is indescribable. The touch of soft, graspy fingers on your chest and the warm, wiggly body in your arms is something to treasure. Over time, the graspy fingers can become claws though and that's when its time for nursing jewelry. Nursing jewelry, or teething jewelry as it is sometimes called, is a great accessory for any mother to have. It gives baby something to play with while they are getting a meal or being held. They are especially great for babies who are in slings or carriers often.
By the time the apostle reached the Roman prison, he had received the full revelation of the gospel of the grace of God. Now he was putting into practise the work of God’s grace in his own life. He was setting for us the example how we ought to live in God’s grace. That, according to 2 Timothy 3:12, requires some degree of suffering. “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”

We do not know if the message bore any fruit. We are not told. The law of average would say, “some”. Perhaps some were believers by James definition in Acts 21:20, being “zealous of the law”. Such a message should reinstate them to that faith. Many others were lost and now, for the first time had an eyewitness report of the resurrection of their Messiah. Still others who had been wavering now understood from God’s authority that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God. They now could take that step of faith.

I believe that what has happened in this case owes a great deal to the changed relations between the police and the media as a result of the Leveson Inquiry. A number of statements by senior officers including Mr Hogan-Howe himself, as well as a preposterous review by former parliamentary commissioner for standards Elizabeth Filkin, have insisted that police officers should be extremely wary of ever talking to the media.

Next week Vedaste is in Brussels, so I have 10 days off. I plan to visit the genocide memorials at Nyamata and Ntarama, which are meant to be harrowing. Although I expect it to be a very upsetting experience I think it’s important. I’m also going to go to Butare and visit the national museum and university. Then on Thursday (at 5.45 no less!) I’m catching the 9 hour hour bus to Kampala to stay with Angela for a few days. I’m also going white water rafting at Jinja which I’m regarding with equal parts excitement and trepidation! Grade 5 is higher than anything I’ve done before and by all reports the chances of getting through without the raft flipping are next to none. (But I’m sure I’ll be fine Mum, Dad and Andy, and I checked my insurance covers it!) And hey, at least I’m not trying the bungee jumping!

1988 Graeme Hick, Worcestershire's 21 year year old cricketer, scored more than 400 runs in a county championship match, the highest innings in England this century.
Of course every day here looks like a sunny day you’d find front and center in a postcard and the film is super full of the values that are adored by the conservative demographic that makes up a nice portion of Mr. Sparks’ target audience, while still providing the sexy scenes with the sexy actors to draw in the other demos. But it kind of works as that romance in Louisiana story; it’s just hurt quite a lot by the fact that the secret that Logan’s keeping just looms over the whole movie even if it’s not mentioned, especially because it’s not that big a deal when you dissect it had he just told it when he arrived there. But it’s when the film tries to go all heavy-handed dramatic with Beth’s ex that it’s just too bad to bear.

If you recall, at a previous Knitting and Stitching show, I got a bit carried away with the Jelly Rolls in my efforts to build up a stash of scraps for the Tokyo Subway Quilt. Since that flurry of impulsiveness I have sobered up to the realisation that Jelly Rolls are somewhat challenging to work with. For a beginner-quilter, with no fabric stash, there is a limited number of patterns that can be worked from a single jellyroll. You are further limited by the selection of fabrics and colour choices included in the roll – not all of which are the same quality, it turns out. It doesn’t help if you’ve cannibalised a few jellyrolls for another project and decide to cobble the remainders into a project. As I have done!

So, there you have it. Yes, the up and down look happened to me today, and yes, it made me feel like crap. I know, I know...no one can make you feel like crap besides you but still. The fact that it was a chinless, boobless doofus doing the looking was small comfort when I already felt just blechhy about myself, about my hopelessly outdated mom clothes, about my increasingly Michelle Duggar-esque hair. I need a makeover, a head-to-toe makeover, pronto.

Since July I have been experimenting with this new way of connecting. With Sonar by my side at networking events, I can go into a room and feel more at ease knowing industries people work in, what they do, and how I’m connected to them.

The soft colours of traditional Harris Tweed are famously inspired by – indeed originally dyed by – the colours of the Scottish landscape. These days, though, tweed is woven in all colours and has become a staple of the fashion set. Looking at the zing of this purple and orange together, though – and throwing in that blue we saw earlier – I realised that even the brightest tweeds could still be inspired by nature. And by sheep dip. Scotland is indeed a marvelous place.

Swedish police must "be able to use the equipment that has been acquired for large amounts," the Dagens Nyheter daily wrote in an opinion piece. "Helicopters, cars, boats and other equipment must be kept in a way so that criminals cannot sabotage them."
So you have an idea for a beginning, a couple of middle parts and an end that have nothing to do with each other and you have no idea how to get from one to another? That's fine. It's way too early to panic and give up. It might be that you'll be working things out as you go along, just writing until you hit one of those key scenes. Or it might be that you never actually write any of those middle scenes because by the time you get to the middle you realise an event like that simply couldn't happen in the world you've created, or that your character just wouldn't act that way. The same with endings. You could be like J K Rowling and write the final scene seven books in advance and stick to it (yikes) or you could be like me and aim for that final scene as a guide but usually end up realising the actual events are all wrong, and it's just one or two things, like a character's feelings, or the location or mood that you need. Or you might be like Leah Clifford and have no IDEA how it's going to end (she's a better man than I am, Gunga Din).

In both the case of too little catecholamine activity and too much, the effect on the PFC is to put it in a state of distraction, disorganization, forgetfulness, and lack of inhibition, while the perfect amount of catecholamine release enables the person to be focused, organized and responsible. In other words (I find this fascinating) too little engagement and too much stress both take us to the same ineffective place. In order to be at our best, we need to be in balance.

Lee’s arrest and death should be a nice way of ending the whole trial saga with both Jack and Daniel but considering the damage it’s caused with Declan and Charlotte as well; it’s not going to be that easy. Declan couldn’t be swayed when it came to discrediting his former girlfriend’s reliability as a witness and that too was something of a conflict to watch.

“Help me into the front seat. You drive. Don’t forget the kid, but don’t get her until you got him in my trunk.

After the 1949 season, the Newark Bears were moved out of town. In 1950, the Newark Eagles folded operations also. And just like that..., Newark's glory days of Baseball were over.

I am giving them their 30-days notice that was in our nanny agreement, even though my new job would prefer I start on December 9th. At first, she said she understood wanting a job in my field, but soon she burst into tears, said she can't believe she has to search for a nanny again and telling me she hired me because she thought I would be devoted to her children and how is she supposed to hire a stranger when I know the ins and outs of this family (but, wasn't I a stranger just 5 months ago?).

So who is dead in the Joseon era? They never showed her face and there’s obviously some massive cover up going on. I would think the Crown Prince would have identified her corpse by her face and not just her clothing but if there’s a twist in this at all, it would be that the Crown Princess murdered her sister out of jealousy and will pretend to be her by wearing the veil and will later make the Prince fall in love with her as she impersonates her sister . Yes, this is a convoluted theory because why not just kill the younger sister and live on as herself? I did say if. Or maybe Crown Prince will return, take off the veil and see what his sister-in-law really looks like but that would mean Park Ha ends up alone. So for the sake of my sanity, they need to make it so that both their doppelgangers are dead so they can be together in whichever era they choose.
My headache has returned and I'm taking the painkillers again along with two tranquilizers a day to help relax me.

Many thanks to Jennifer Bartlett, Sheila Black, and Michael Northern for bringing several of us together, who are interested in discourses around "disability," and then spending much of this year editing our collected contributions of poetry and essay to the forthcoming anthology, Beauty Is A Verb: An Anthology of Poetry, Poetics, and Disability. Of course I've yet to see most of the specific contributions herein, but knowing many of the current contributors' work more generally, I think it safe to say that this anthology will, as Jennifer notes below, be wide-ranging within the largely contested bounds of disability studies as examined poetically. Many thanks too to those who contributed to Nonsite Collective's curricula on somatic practices, the commons, and disability/post-abelism. The curricula span the years 2008-present and each suite, as intersecting with the others, has influenced my thinking/writing thru "disability" -- perhaps more than any other one transitory locus of activity. (See the curriculum pages for past talks/discussions/performances etc.)

Twenty four hours – 1440 Minutes – 86400 seconds are all we have to go through a vast list of action items planned for our daily sustenance, personal and professional growth. Obviously this is too small a span to cram everything in it, and hence the need to plan and manage effectively. For a woman, sadly, the complexities are a little more pronounced than for men. Working women face myriad issues that have to be recognized and handled sensitively.

So here’s how I made the chicken stock, a clear or white stock (as opposed to it’s dark beef or veal sisters). I chose it because I use it a lot and chicken wings are a heck of a lot easier to find than fish heads. Rent a good movie (again, I recommend The Soloist) and make yourself a stock too. Put it in your freezer, in manageable qualities and see how much better your dishes turn out. Go ahead. I dare you.

Enough of my rambling, I've been up all night again and with only a couple of hours of dreamland the night before... I need to drag myself into bed now.

Last night they played every song from their album with tons of energy and smiles, and I have to say that they did a fantastic job. I am incredibly proud of them for all they have accomplished and it is really nice for me to be able to see them grow as musicians. I started watching them play about a year and a half ago (in October 2010). In that time, they have expanded their fanbase, written more songs, and created an awesome album. They’ve also somehow become more talented (never saw that coming) and they’ve made live performances even more fun than before. I love to see people that I care about loving what they do, which is exactly what The Little Black Dress does. You can tell by watching them on stage that they are completely in their element and love what they do, which makes me happier than you could ever understand.

Different talks were underway in this regard, some people were of the view that on Feb 13 PM Gilani will step down while others were of the view that PM will be convicted, but premier showed extreme maturity by appearing before the apex court. The main point which is to be noted is it that no PPP worker indulged in any violent protest across the country. This is highly laudable.

I jest, I moan and I guffaw in the mirror, but in truth it was fun, enlightening and painless. Well, aside from the eye poking, back stabbing and hair pulling of course.
The Nerdery is famous in the Twin Cities as a great place to work and play. So when nerds take time out to fire up the grill and invite the neighborhood over to see the new expanded headquarters, it’s a fun time to say the least. The retro theme referred to a bunch of games brought out of storage: what Angry Birds??? For Shareology it broke down into games, shirts and photo booth — and away we go!!
I have a special guest on my blog today! His name is HT Night and he's an indie author of paranormal romance. I think you all would really enjoy his books so I wanted to get him on my blog! So, without further ado...here's HT!

Given the amount of financial stimulation that the Fed has pumped into the economy with limited apparent impact along with the recently stated willingness to do even more raises a fairly large red flag. While such action may keep interest rates artificially low, they have been at these low levels for some time with little economic improvement to show for it given the magnitude of the cash infusion. This is much like has been the case for decades in Japan. While these low rates may force savers to abandon fixed income to buy equities in search of a better return, to me this inflation of the stock market is artificial (although as the saying goes it is difficult to fight the tape).

These dark porters, brewed in England but popular with Russian royalty, were high in alcohol, sweet, and dense, and survived the journey from Britain to the Baltic and across Russia. They are still popular in the Baltic states, where they are still brewed. Samuel Smith’s of Yorkshire produces a fine example.
Crist lays out Wertham's impressive credentials and case histories involving juvenile crime and the reading of comic books, conceding a distinction that while every child who read comic books didn't go on to perform violent acts, all juveniles who "do" perform violent acts read comic books. If comic book reading was causing a population increase in juvenile crime, then my big question to the society of the 1940's is where were the parents?
The use of any portion of the jewish and/or anti-White versions of history as an accusation, assigning collective responsibility and guilt to Whites. This is a form of psychological aggression - an attack on White self-worth and self-confidence, placing Whites on the defensive.
When I was younger I did this in a much more obvious manner. I might use my fingers or chewing gum to make marks of how big my teeth had grown (after I lost my baby teeth of course.)

So its that time of year, where things end and new things begin. I was trying to think of how to do this, since last year I made a series of posts about my favorite pictures of the year and the stories behind them. While I do have some favorite photos from this year, but I wanted this to be a bit more about other things I enjoyed this year as well. So here are my favorite things from this year, in no real order, as they come to me.
Stumbled across the Ad Contrarian blog a while ago and… it is by far my favourite blog. I grabbed this wonderful book as soon as I could as I wanted to have the best of Bob close at hand…. As a long time ad guy who cut his teeth on the work of Ogilvy, Bernbach et al, I just love the way Bob thinks and writes about our crazy business and even more crazy world. This is take no prisoners kind of stuff that is just superbly written always. Buy it, read it. If you are like me it will make you laugh, make you cry and shake your head in wonder.
A further P. Oxy. text from volume 63 has more to say on this topic in its narrative of the lion hunt and the kataphytosis which followed:
When 26-year-old Emily Weiss launched Into the Gloss, a blog chronicling the highly detailed beauty routines of fashion insiders, she was already a fashion-industry veteran. She logged in years on fashion shoots while interning at Teen Vogue during college, and became a fashion assistant to Vogue contributing stylist Elissa Santisi after graduating.

The blender is a good tool for removing heavy ink buildups even if it won't erase completely on glossy, but it also discolors the area around it slightly and can cause even more little ridges like the ones you were trying to remove in the first place. Use it carefully as a removing tool but be careful since a little goes a long way. Also remember to clean the tip really well after using it with glossy paper.

Well, the hand can tell you a lot about what may be wrong, or right, with a patient: and even the nails can provide clues to the the individuals health, and not just about their social status! Here are some of the things that Doctors look for:

And the case can be made for any group's claim to victimization even now. It does not serve the cause of liberty, equality under the law, or any of the tenets necessary for a society of free individual humans.
It may all sound very crude. But that's the way this team won during the regular season. And now the playoffs demand more. Any real analysis at this point is really pointless. We spent a whole season doing that. The playoffs simplify things for us. It's all about Henrik now; Defense; our fore check; and scoring on the power play. Period.
I’ve interviewed some ex-TM officials and they have informed me that even amongst the examiners only Senior Examiners may examine trademark applications. Mere ‘Examiners’ are Group B officers without a degree in law and are hence not allowed to examine trademark applications. The above statistics may appear bone-chilling but it is still an improvement over the previous year of 2009-10, which has been discussed below:
Then, when he's taken to the witness room of the Joliet courthouse, William decides he is going to escape. When the guards allow him to go to the bathroom unsupervised, he climbs out the open window sill and launches himself twelve feet downwards to the grass.

You may want to know how the hell does a beer reach those levels of alcohol. There is no yeast strain that can live in that type of environment so they have to be creative. Basically what they do is brew up a normal strong ale, then use a process somewhat like distillation. Since alcohol has a much lower freezing temperature than water does, the beer is frozen and the ice is taken out of the batch. They repeat the process over and over again until they have what they are looking for. The German's originally came up with the process, and you can read about it here.

This is definitely one of my favorite t-shirt projects, and was totally worth the time it took. In the end it probably took me 3 hours (which is actually less than this one.)
Yes, he’s faced tough opposition from Republicans. But hey, they are the “opposition” party after all. And he has only himself to blame for stinking up the joint so bad in his first two years that it cost the Dems the House in the mid-terms.
But what is being freshly pressed? Blogs that are freshly pressed are displayed on a special tab on the main page of wordpress.com! As you might expect, this brings a great increase in traffic, which in turn will greatly increasethe ammount if people who follow your blog if it is good, or increase the amount of apathy or even hatred you receive if your blog is bad. I have often thought that the worst sort of comment a blogger could ever receive would be a self styled Ignatius Riley replying to a post with a mere “Ho hum.”

I love the way the reflections look – all curved and twisted.
Our absolute favorite pizzeria in San Francisco has to be Pizzeria Delfina. And our absolutely favorite white pizza at Delfina is the broccoli rabe pizza- fresh mozzarella and parmesan topped with broccoli rabe sauted with garlic and red chili flakes and oil cured black olives. There is something wonderful about the combination of bitter, intense broccoli rabe and salty oil cured olives.
Nowadays, with people clamoring for “diversity” and “unhealthy body images,” all I see are the same boring faces and bodies day after day. Where’s the beauty in that? Fashion is all about fantasy; a world where everyone’s ethereally beautiful and skinny, wearing clothes that make angels cry. It is not for everyone. And why would everyone even want to meddle with fashion? As Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach said, “So soon as a fashion is universal, it is out of date.” Some people just don’t get it.

My favorite part is the dude in the hammock at the bottom of the card. First half and second half stats are nice enough, but the hammock really makes this set. Can we call it the hammock set? Night Owl, a ruling please? Edit: I see now that this has been labeled "the pinstriped gangster suit set," which I guess is fair since the cards are named after the fronts. But eh...I'll call it the hammock set myself haha.

I went home and wondered when or if I'll ever get to the point where everyone thinks my chapter is good to go. Don't get me wrong, I love the feedback. It's invaluable.
The first serial I wrote came as a request from Gaynor Davies, Fiction Editor of Woman’s Weekly. The magazine had published two 6000 word “cosy crime” stories of mine within a period of a year, both featuring the same heroine, DC Casey Clunes. When some seven years ago Gaynor suggested I might try my hand at writing a full-length, 3 or 4 part crime serial I must admit that initially I was thrown into total panic.
After the recordings of the second album Den Sista Vintern, Cathrine and Sank left the band and was replaced with Magnus Lindh (who been assisting engineer during the recordings of Den Sista Vintern and had played in Rasta Hunden) on vocals and keyboards and Patrik Högl on drums. Cathrine formed synthpioneers Dockhuset and Sank went to USA to become a drummer for Richard Lloyd and later became a well known producer producing Thåström, Killing Joke and Paradise Lost among others.
In our sexually dimorphic society, the above categories of individuals not clearly identifiable as male or female present awkward issues for the affected individuals, parents, healthcare practitioners, and society. One consequence is a hesitancy to report such occurrences, making it difficult to ascertain the frequency with which these conditions occur. Estimates are that instances of all persons with the varying identities within the category of intersexuality represent 0.06%-1.7% of our communities.
I have just read the fascinating story of three lively young South African girls who went to Europe in the 1960s to spend a year travelling from place to place without spending too much money on their travels. They made use of youth hostels and managed to go from one place to another by hitching rides. Admittedly they had strict rules about hitching so they never came to any harm. Somehow I don’t think it would be possible to do the same trip today as everything is so much more expensive and the South African Rand has diminished in value. The book is well-written and extensively illustrated. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn more about the girls’ fascinating European adventure all those years ago. The book is available in print and Kindle editions.
However, it has not been forgotten in our annals of I WANT THAT NAUGHTY IN MY MOUTH (whoa), and so, as I stood in front of my stove with a whole butternut squash, a whole smoked and crockpotted chicken and a giant leek, it became the answer to the What The Fuck Am I Going To Make From This Shit? question.

The Best Archival Release goes to the massive Warner Bros sixteen-disc, retrospective box-set THE DANNY ELFMAN & TIM BURTON 25TH ANNIVERSARY MUSIC BOX, which was housed in a Zoetrope box and included an exclusive historical book. The winner of Best Archival Re-recording goes to conductor William Stromberg and the Moscow Symphony Orchestra for their re-recording of Bernard Herrmann’s THE BATTLE OF NERETVA and THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. Best Record Label of the Year goes to La-La Land Records, their second win in a row in this category, for such notable 2011 expanded release soundtracks as 1941, SPACE ABOVE AND BEYOND, FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY, COMMANDO and STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION COLLECTION VOLUME 1.
To repeat, if you don't like a book then don't read it or give it to your child. However, it is not your place to dictate to others what they and their children may read.
The composition of the trunk varied in density and uniformity. As I studied the trunk my attention was that of fingering a button on my shirt or scratching at my side. In this world of edgeless blurred vibration, I could not tell what part of the tree trunk was the tree and what part was me. Don’t ask me how or why this was the case. It just was.
So why doesn’t it exist? It is because our financial system is based on something called fractional reserve banking.

Why else do we see music magazines throwing together collections of all their covers throughout the last thirty years, or movie magazines listing “The 100 Greatest Movies Ever Made”? Face it, folks–creativity is just a lot of hard work.
“It’s a complete joke. I can’t believe they have nominated themselves for the award. ‘What about all the complaints that were put in against them when it happened? ‘Life is truly hell. This is an insult to her memory. Tomorrow would have been Hayley’s 18th birthday. ‘It’s just a massive shock. It couldn’t have come at a worse time for the family.”

You’d think that movies would have been based on it, but you’d be wrong. There is a move afoot to make a movie about the killings, only with a black policemen-hero, in inspectors Gus Coreris and John Fotinos’ stead. And that “hero” is not Insp. Rotea Gilford, but rather a politician named Ed Sanders, who via Officers for Justice made it all the way to chief, but who made no contribution that I could find to the Zebra investigation.

“An Irish Pharisee!” he exclaimed! “What?” said his priest. “Where did you get that from”? It’s John 3:1 – “Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nic O’demus…” says he.
Not a crucifix this,
No! I have a problem with people in the healing professions, who are supposed to have some compassion, hurting me and thinking that it's funny.
"Ground us." Jashi's voice held steady despite the hundreds of feet of air between them and the ground. Technically, it was Pevan's call to bring the jumping to an end, but the Warder was right. If the Wildhawk didn't turn back towards Federas, there was nothing more they could do. She gritted her teeth as she turned them over for the descent again. Fat chance the Wilder would leave the town alone, but it wasn't worth risking the peace to pre-empt it.

I was so excited after getting these samples built that I had to share them right away, just a couple quick snaps with the camera phone and thru the magic of the internet... there you have it! You saw it here first!
In meetings I have found my arguments being less than crisp; my reports are not quite as accurate; my project documentation is not as well thought through and generally I feel like I’m lacking the edge that used to define my work.
Soon enough, the warm spotlight was touching me and my words were on display to a full house. I was introduced as my Left Side name (definitely have to do that more often). My nerves were on fire.
My son graduated from high school last friday, so darn exciting, it had to be the windest day in history. Every graduate had to hold there caps down tHe entire time, one girls hat flew off and across the field before she even hit the grass. I have no pictures of him with the family with the cap and gown on (windy) he promised to take some shots for me later! My 75-300 zoom lense was fabulous, I was like the paparazzi during the ceremony with my Camera!

Take ACTION! By now you will have greater clarity and with that comes certainty. But it’s easy to just go with the good feeling of knowing you have a goal and the “prospect” of achieving it and so often people stop here. The journey hasn’t started yet! You need to take step 5 and that is, ACTION. You have to do something, anything, from the list you generated in step 4. Start anywhere, you will quickly learn what you don’t know and what you need to do in more detail so with practice you will become very resourceful (which comes in abundance by the way, you just have to start, strangely, magic happens!)
Banana Man: Oh I've wanted to be one ever since I was little. My interest stems from that.
Nothing shall hinder the accomplishment of the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God; for “whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate;” and “whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.” It is all done in God’s account, and nothing in earth or hell can undo it.

Margaret Fleming, the JLL director of investment at JLL says that the Q1, 2011 figures do not include the effect of the proposed abolition of Upward Only Rent Reviews (UORRs) which, she claims, would lead to a “20 to 30 per cent” further decline in capital values. This is the first time I have seen an estimate over 20% to reflect the proposed changes to UORRs. The then-Society of Chartered Surveyors inIreland indicated that the estimated decline would be 20% for its portfolio that it assesses with IPD to produce its commercial prices index which rivals JLL’s.

Mr Sheridan began by his questioning by asking Mr Wight if it would be fair to describe him as gatekeeper for “the dark side”. Mr Wight disagreed, and asked whether Mr Sheridan mean the question literally, and was enquiring into his status as a Jedi Knight.
But what about closer to home, what about so called racial intolerance, freedom of speech, overzealous policing, black gangs, raping of white women, mass immigration, free housing for ethnics at the expense of the indigenous population and so on?
In most cases that free offer will be some sort of report. When you create your title you want to make them eager to get their hands on that report.

What might first strike you about this is the darker, more violent tone of the animated film. It is rated PG-13. So, it’s not a children’s film. There is blood and a guy getting set on fire. There’s brutality and murder. It has heavy themes rolling through it of death, murder, redemption, revenge, sorrow, grief, and regret. It is designed for a mature audience able to handle heavier subject matter, and grasp the emotional weight of the story.
Brush a large baking sheet with curry butter and lay your squash rounds down on the baking sheet. Scoop filling into the center of the rings and drizzle the remaining curry butter over the squash. Bake until squash is tender about 30 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer rings to plates when serving, so filling isn't left behind.
Also, if we remember the events of spring 2011 in Bahrain, when the ruling Sunni regime launched a bloody crackdown on Shiite protesters, the case went almost unnoticed in the U.S. The reason was that Bahrain serves as one of the most important bases for the U.S. Fifth Fleet.
Your voice, even from such distance, holds me captive. It makes me tremble with bitter-sweet longings. Like a fawn feather it gently churns the milk of my heart and creates deeper play than the words can create. Behind my ear the temperature rises. The warm flush slowly spreads through me. A musky tickle along the spine. It’s the fuel that feeds me, nourishes me, gives me life. It’s not just a sound, it has a soul, a body, unadorned, deep, rich, sensuasly splendid. Sultry, like a summer breeze. From across the miles it reaches out, touches me, sweeps me off my feet, lifts me to the heights unknown as I lose myself to it and surrender to those brief periods of orgasmic bliss.
Today I talked to a counselor and made an appointment for me and the grrl.
We finally find Jonah and Stiletta walking up to the cave (Let's see, twelve miles at three miles an hour is four hours, but they are injured so let's say six hours later). They rig up a torch and head into the cave and quickly find the pool of clean water. However, they also find...
If this result were overturned by a court or international body, rather than by a further referendum, this would be an outrageous and very dangerous precedent, as it would signify the end of democracy and of national self determination in any meaningful way. What next? Regime change by tribunal?
For a craft beer lover loosing the LBS's is not an easy thing. Beer is the antithesis for trying to loose weight. It is a very nutritious beverage, high in calories and carbohydrates. I never sought out the "low carb beers" over the last year because.... Well, that's not beer, at least the beer I know and love. But it got me to thinking, what is the lowest carb beer option for a beer snob like myself?
Albert Camus said that "We all carry within us our places of exile, our crimes, and our ravages" and he was right on but when he said that "our task is not to unleash them on the world" he obviously wasn't talking about the Crimefactory.

In the passive hydraulic unit, the fluid is displaced not from one chamber to another, but via pipes through a valve block and into the opposite hydraulic unit.

The later appointment of medical personnel did not improve the conditions. They were appointed for their loyalty towards the British invasion; not for their medical capability. They maltreated the Boere.
Overall, a very simple image, and coloring was really quick (scanning and writing the tutorial took a lot longer than coloring the image!) I hope you have as fun and easy a time coloring it as I did.

Jack Ponton complains of noise in rural environments. But these are hardly silent as any visiting townie who has been rudely awakened by cockerels or church bells will attest. It is the nature of the noise which is novel - and country bumpkins will soon become as accustomed to it as are urbanites to the sound of road and rail.

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.”

Baird Jubilation Ale - If figs were a delicacy in Biblical times, then Baird Jubilation Ale might be a special beer for Jesus to crack open after a long day of preaching, telling parables and cleansing temples of corrupt money changers. Brewed with candied figs and spiced with cinnamon, this Japanese beer would make Christ take a drink and say "For the love of Dad, this is good!" On a related (but not really that related) note, apparently Jesus Christ's tomb is in Japan.

Bastianich also has some good old-fashioned vendettas to settle. He calls chef Pino Luongo “a withering d-----bag.” Le Cirque’s Sirio Maccioni is a Restaurant Man “facing oblivion.” San Domenico’s Tony May is “a great Restaurant Man, but enough is enough. Take your wife to Positano.” Hospitality maverick Danny Meyer, whom he respects, “single-handedly spread this cancer of a five-day workweek through our industry.” (There’s no mention of the tip-skimming class-action lawsuit against Bastianich and his partners, which was settled last month when his company agreed to a $5.25 million payout.)

Papaw had one glass eye. To get a rise out of us girls, he would pretend to sneeze and then pop his eye out onto the kitchen table! Uh, just thinking about it grosses me out. Last year, he was Willy Nelson for the church festival. He was so cool.

One such Wetherspoons pub in Glasgow which has upped their beer game recently is Hengler's Circus on Sauchiehall Street. I was in over the weekend and was mightily impressed when I walked in and discovered that all eight handpumps had been taken over by fab Scottish Brewery Harviestoun which showcased, excellently, the full range of their beers on offer. For a full four days there was nothing but lovely, tasty Harviestoun beer served from the pub's pumps.
(Italian) See you soon,
You sat me down and made a case for matrimony and I told you you would be the first invited if I ever got married. I held your hand and listened as you described why you loved being married to Grandma all those years. You guys were a pair. Donning affection and arguing with equal passion and volume. You told me how sad you were that my parents divorced and how you were worried about my dad. At the time, you guys were still not getting along. I know he loved you and Grandma, but you guys were always so critical and righteous and crazy when it came to him. You guys constantly butted heads. I held his hand at your funeral. You, he and I haven't spent time together since I was a little girl. He had no idea that you and I were close. I think it made him so happy to know that you and I were close all those years he felt he had to keep his distance from you guys. At the funeral, dad kept saying to me with awe in his eyes "You really loved the old guy didn't you?" Of course I did. And I had no idea how much I would miss you and Grandma and your stories and lectures. No Idea.

I make a living (or rather am working hard at building a living) from my recipes both food and home art. Creation of good to eat victuals and healthy home products from heritage and/or natural ingredients are a passion for me. It is so thrilling when someone asks for a recipe or how to make a specific soap. What is the saying?
That last one reminded me of my patient who had had their aorta repaired just the day before. Since it was the part of the aorta that passes by and supplies blood to the stomach and intestines, she was NPO (no eating or drinking). She asked for ice chips and I explained that she couldn't have any.

If you’re getting into a fight with your dad or your mom and you’re about to ask them for the down payment on a new car, chances are you should keep you political leanings to yourself. However, if you’re arguing with your father-in-law and you’re secure in your marriage and you already have a home, PUSH THE ENVELOPE. Not so much that your wife leaves the Thanksgiving table crying, but enough that your dad-in-law knows you’re not a p*ssy and that this liberal/democratic/republican/libertarian thing is not a rash that’s going to go away.

I wrote some time back about sensing a shift in blogging, about it becoming more community based. It's here and I've just noticed that it generated more comments than any other post. That's because there are a thousand different reasons why an individual keeps a blog and each one of them is valid. The reasons for not blogging are just as valid but they don't form the basis of an argument that blogging has declined. They just mean the person doesn't have the time or the inclination which is absolutely fine.
The length of glass lit up like the face of a skyscraper at night, powering on in a roar of illumination. The Citadel moaned answering my call from a long forgotten slumber. I could feel it awakening under my fingertips, welcoming me. I could hear life emerging beyond the glass, roused by the energies flowing through fractured black mirrors.

Sometimes you have to ignore conventional wisdom.
The thing is that this isn't always possible. And what I've discovered is that it especially isn't always possible if you've recently split up with your girlfriend, you're waking up at 6am every morning to write a novel and even at the best of times you're naturally disposed paranoia and insecurity of every kind.

After racially abusing BBC’s Johah Fisher in April, 2010, after Fisher remarked that Malema lives in an affluent suburb of Johannesburg, Malema was unapologetic about his actions. He accused Fisher of being disrespectful and of coming from a country that undermines the credibility and integrity of African leaders. But Malema’s narcissism is most evident in his insistence that Fisher apologise after the incident, despite the fact that the ANC and President Jacob Zuma condemned Malema’s outburst.
He has appointed us to bear fruit. What fruit? Fruit that lasts! The only real fruit that will last, when all else has given way, is our love for one another. But still I think preachers are terrified to preach this sort of sacrificial obedient love to congregations. You know what I mean: God wants ME to be happy and successful and fulfilled. That message sells, and big time in this current configuration of the world. But what about the demanding, sacrificial love that lays down its life for others? What about the sort of love that fails to consider whatever benefits we might otherwise enjoy? What about the sort of love that gives of the self and keeps on giving?

:: Stand-up comics have to deal with hecklers. You might think that usually a quip or two gets the job done...but not always. Some comics don't go for the surgical strike of a quick, devastating quip. Instead, they go for incendiary explosives, followed by salting the earth above their hecklers' dried remains so that nothing ever grows there again. (Foul language in every one of these...but if you watch any, be sure to watch Patton Oswalt's, whose takedown of his heckler achieves a kind of poetry.)
Brooklyn girl, a lifetime back East spent on concrete and under immense dusty old-growth trees, or in the rumination of pine-dark, cold mountainscapes, could feel so right, here: the strange heat, the scrubby thirsty land remind me of my own bones, my foundation; and the vast sky, alive with clouds, releases the bonds of gravity. Looking up I am convinced I could fly!
Randed shoes are losing popularity by this time period. That's not to say they don't exist, but the English seem to use them much less commonly after 1760 (this is the only post-1750 example on the Shoe Icons site). It makes for a much sturdier shoe, and the sole can be replaced. The rand is stitched to the upper, then the rand is stitched to the outsole, all right side out.

We’re told that God just was, but surely he must have been created somehow, heaven and hell would have been created too and so somehow this doesn’t seem like the complete picture. But on the other hand, from the way I’ve heard people describe it, the Big Bang is basically a case of there was nothing and then it exploded. But nothing can’t explode and become something because in order to explode there has to be something there so it must have been created before then. So the question is, how was it created? By God? Who surely must have been created in some way shape or form by something? So technically then the world isn’t real and it’s all just a dream. Of who? The God which mysteriously exists with no clues as to how he began? So technically then we shouldn’t exist.
From there I suggested that we look at meekness in the context of community via a couple of passages from Paul’s letters using the word and surrounding it with a bunch of other behaviours.
No. 55 RK Motors Toyota driver Brian Vickers started sixth and finished 18th in Sunday’s 515-lap NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Martinsville Speedway. Vickers started on the outside of row three, but dropped to 28th before he could move from the outside to the inside lane. Unfortunately, track position is key at Martinsville Speedway and the Thomasville, N.C., native spent the rest of the race fighting to stay on the lead lap. He lost a lap on lap 202 then regained it when he took the wave around on lap 360. A pit stop for gas with about 50 laps remaining cost him two laps he never made up. The No. 55 team returns to action Saturday, April 14th at Texas Motor Speedway with Mark Martin behind the wheel. Vickers next appearance in the No. 55 is June 24 at Infineon Raceway.
I will keep you posted on how much I use the vest. I certainly hope it doesn’t become another in a long string of exercise paraphernalia that I’ve bought and not used. I need to make a concentrated effort to use it on a regular basis, and then see if it gets easier. That should demonstrate that something is improving on me physically – ideally more muscles! And since I’m having my metabolic rate tested this Friday, if they test it again in 3 months (which is the idea, on the premise that we are going to “up” the exercise during that time), then hopefully the results will show there as well.

They clearly don't think it's necessary to tell us what a turnkey solution is, so I checked with Wisegeek (much plagiarised by students, I note in passing) where I am told that a turnkey solution is "a solution that can easily be implemented based on the resources already at the disposal of a company or individual." I'm not sure that gets me much further, but maybe it means that ProLicht will make you some signs that you can
An extremely important example of when to manage expectations is with children. Managing expectations is a huge part of parenting. However this pales in comparison to the far more grave responsibility of managing the expectations of the much larger equivalents of children…..adults. Everyone at every age is susceptible to all of these effects, however ignorant, scared or maladjusted people can have these effects magnified. Unfortunately to many Americans, hearing the word ignorant has the automatic connotation of willful ignorance, usually based on prejudice. This differs greatly from many places in the 3rd world where you encounter more generalized ignorance, usually based on poor education and lack of resources. This type of ignorance (like other types) is often accompanied by fear. People are scared of the unknown, and a looming unknown invites any number of elevated expectations in all directions. If it is part of your job (Peace Corps volunteer, community relations ex-pat etc) to deal with ignorant populations, it becomes imperative to preemptively assuage any fear or confusion and ground expectations. Something I have learned from living down here is that the smaller the community, the worse they transmit information. I am obligated to communicate something to either the entire community, or no one. If I only tell a small group of people a plan, wage, or any other type of job specification, by the time it reaches the other members of the community it is distorted and corrupted beyond belief.
Had Dunham’s stories not been held up as some sort of shining light in the sexist darkness of TV, I doubt anyone would have raised so much of a fuss. But it’s being told that she’s somehow a wonderful story of victory over adversity that leaves a bad taste. If the goal is to tell the stories of women in a way that’s different from what we’ve seen before, surely we could’ve chosen someone whose stories weren’t actually all that different at all, save for the biological sex of the people experiencing them.
I remember as a young child standing in the middle of a library, overwhelmed by the rows and rows of books that towered high above my head. I loved the smell of waxed wooden floors and glue. And mostly I loved that I could read any of them that I wanted to! Later as we were in high school and college, many late nights were spent at long wooden tables, laden with the books we’d found to search for information that would amaze our teachers and professors. We didn’t have to own all of the high tech gadgets because the library could help us access whatever we needed. Now, we enjoy bringing our grandchildren to browse the picture book section and visit the story time lady, or find a book to take along for the drive to a distant destination—something we can “get lost” in to help the miles melt away.
I mention that, only so I can tell the following story. On Wednesday, the news included a story about the passing of “60 Minutes” reporter Ed Bradley. The story mentioned the fact that Ed Bradley was black, which I was unaware of, though I knew who he was for many years.

Incidentally, I find the Pink Panther one of the funniest cartoons AND THE CHARACTERS NEVER TALKED! Imagine that.

I'm going to do a more detailed blog post next week sometime about branding, advertising, marketing and connecting with people, so I won't say too much on the topic now, but it boils down to this; you can be, or look, too slick. Professionalism is a good thing to cultivate, but self-promotion is annoying. I've never done formal very well - I wear a certain amount of scruffiness in my soul, and with pride - and ultimately I don't want to use marketing tricks to artificially boost my performance.
The next example is MENASOR – I’ll let the pics do the talking….and yes, I own these now! Enjoy…

There are other pressures on us, too. Pressures that have nothing to do with our writing but everything to do with the market place. In a squeezed market, there is more and more demand from publishers for novels that will sell. Books that fit into an obvious, popular genre - action, dark romance, whatever. A book that is perceived as 'too literary' is seen as problematic. The equivalent of the literary novel is a rare beast, and becoming more endangered by the minute. If one or two do sneak through, they usually turn out to have been written for adults in the first place and tweaked a bit in a bid to capture that holy grail, the crossover market.
This situation is not optimal, however, as faithful priests begin to enter the communities which have been led astray often for years at a time, this is going to be the experience. My experience as a police officer taught me a lot. The world is full of "no" people. There will always be those people who simply refuse to accept authority. They are typically the loudest and they typically push the hardest. That is until, they realize you are not going to back down. Certainly, this is not the way in which the Bishop would have wanted things to work out. In fact, the letter is a plea for the faithful to change course. None of us and especially the Bishop want to see anyone leave the Church, however, the Church must be a beacon of truth. Remaining in that truth the free will of those who do not prefer it, must be allowed to choose whether they will remain and give her obedience, or reject her and become apostates. Nevertheless, he is bound by his office and his love for Christ to defend and teach the faith, regardless, of how it may make the faithful feel. Please pray for our Bishop, he is a courageous and holy man, who seeks to bring those who have strayed back into the fold.
I like that there is a lot going on in it! Little treasures hidden here and there amongst the baubles.

I hand cut flowers from the Cherry Cordial, Sour Cherry and Lollipop papers. I made this cute little banner by folding the flowers in half and stringing twine in between the folds. The boarder around the layout was made using my Silhouette machine and stitched on. I did a lot of machine stitching in this layout because my it reminds me of how my mother spent many long hours making clothes for my sisters and I.
You see, its human nature to believe that if we just had a little more, or a slightly better something, our lives would be perfect.
That means, first of all, on the open web. Here, librarianship differs from traditional academic disciplines. In the academic world, most discussions take place in small networks of colleagues (“invisible colleges”), often at seminars and conferences, and through the established mechanism of peer review. In young professions like teaching, nursing, accountancy and librarianship, practitioners get their information from easy-to-read articles on the web and in technical (not academic) magazines. Their professional discussions mostly take place with colleagues on the job – not with specialists abroad.
So we really hope you'll play!

I like to think that the Teich Archive has an additional element that sets it apart from these other postcard collections and gives it a unique visual voice. Upstairs in the Teich Archives dozens of metal file cabinets stand like upright treasure chests holding little gems of the past. Over 100,000 art files used by the Teich artists to create postcards from 1925 through the mid-1950s are housed in these cabinets. Some files are empty, but others may contain tiny watercolor sketches of the final postcard created by the artists for the customer’s approval, original packaging, carpet samples, wallpaper and dozens of other artifacts from the last century. I‘ve seen a sample package of Dr. Witzel’s Cigarettes for Asthmatics, Art Deco inspired carpet pieces, a snapshot of Thomas Edison that someone had thumbtacked to a wall, and real peacock feathers in those files. More importantly these elements of twentieth century life, this odd little collection of visual snippets or perhaps the only remaining photos of buildings that have been demolished for decades, exist nowhere else. Because the contents of these files have yet to be cataloged, there is always an element of anticipation when you pull one from the cabinet.

The building's quarantined for a week. Fumigated and completely shut down. Fear of infection is the last thing a controversial mining company needs to accelerate their already bad press on environmental sloppiness. Workers take leave, some are laid off until the risk of infection is cleared. While the sun shines outside and the autumn winds clear the air, it's insecticide and anti-bacterial fog within. They'd attracted unwanted attention in the past with their psychometric profiling of staff and reckless abandon of OH&S issues, the last thing they need is the press getting hold of this.
High Fantasy has its basis a kind of idealized society, and most High Fantasy plots revolve around a threat to that society. One or more of its members, often the lowliest must face up to the threat and return the world to its natural state. (You’ll noted that this is a good capsule summary of LOTR). The threat is usually personified evil in the form of a sorcerer, warlord, or unchained demon. High Fantasy allows a lot of scope to explore character and relationships.
On another occasion at a very good hotel as I was waiting at the pass to take some meals, something in my peripheral vision caught my eye.I saw the Chef de Partie who was doing starters drop a cooked Quail on the floor,glance furtively sideways, then pick it up,dust if off with his oven cloth,then go ahead and compile the finished dish.The Head Chef clocked this at the same time that I did.It was a Saturday night,the kitchen were up the wall, checks were piling on and tempers were frazzled.The proverbial wire was about to snap.Cooking another dish would have meant discarding the rest of the starters(which were ready to go) and the main courses which had already been put on to cook to coincide with the starters being finished.This restaurant had 2 rosettes.The Head Chef knew Id seen it.It was face off at the pass.He held my gaze steadily and through gritted teeth,lips unmoving in a straight, thin white line hissed 'if you don't take it they'll have to wait another 20 minutes and the whole of the rest of the night will be a total f**k up and it'll be your fault and YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WILL TAKE THE FLACK'

Having said this, it is important that the baby sitter doesn’t take the ‘reasonable leeway’ given to them to carry out their mission and then toss the instructions out and invent their own ‘methods of operation’. This would not be fitting, appropriate or responsible and such action would jeopardize not only the children’s safety but the opportunity to get additional baby-sitting jobs from these parents and the loss of a good ‘letter of recommendation’ should one be desired, in the future, by the baby-sitter.

I don't feel guilty and I'm not beating myself up and I'm not asking you to tell me I'm a great Mom. I'm guessing Bean and Peabody didn't notice a huge difference in their everyday lives. Taking time for my own interests and pursuits can actually make me better at nurturing and encouraging theirs. I just know that last week I let the emotional, heart-balance slip too far toward myself, and too far away from my number one job: them. They got some good stuff from me -- Bean and I had a great date yesterday afternoon - lunch and a play with our friends, and I set aside time every day to spend reading to Peabody. But they also got left to their own devices at times that, when I see them in the rear-view mirror, I wish they'd had their Mom fully engaged, loving and laughing and comforting and guiding rather than impatiently scolding or barking instructions over a shoulder as her eyes were locked on this bright, magnetic screen.

The next appointment we had was with the developmental pediatrician. This was an appointment that we were pretty nervous about. At this appointment she was looked at by a physical therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist, speech therapist, and then the developmental pediatrician. Everything went really well. We were told by the physical therapist that she has improved quite a bit and that she sees no reason why she wouldn 't be able to walk. Everyone else said she looked great. The pediatrician reviewed everyones notes and then came in the room to speak with us. All he could do during the appointment was smile. He said that he is very happy with her progress and he described her as highly intelligent. He said that there wasn't anything she needed to be working on because in a lot of areas she has advanced!

Mainstream archeology hasn’t been exactly welcoming. Mr. Freeman says journals have rejected his papers and conferences have denied him a platform. Although he hasn’t read Canada’s Stonehenge, University of Alberta archeologist Jack Ives is familiar with Mr. Freeman’s theories. He says recent research suggests some astronomical knowledge developed in Central and South America flowed north to the plains, where it was adapted by people for their own purposes. “There is some basis for thinking there was sophisticated astronomical knowledge,” says Mr. Ives. But what exactly is manifested in the medicine wheels? “They may certainly reflect solstices and equinoxes. How much more sophisticated beyond that has been a subject of debate.” But Mr. Ives points out the terrain in question is an ancient glacial moraine, full of naturally occurring rocks. “You have to be very careful about what you line up.”

Defining the self by bodily limits comes into question in a very simple experiment often performed in Psych 101 classes around the country. A person is asked to sit at a table with one hand above the table and one hand below it. On the table is a rubber hand, placed where the person’s real hand would have been. The subject’s hand under the table is stroked with a feather while the rubber hand above is being stroked. The subjects are confused about which hand is real. They feel the tickle of the feather in the rubber hand and sometimes try to pull it away, perceiving the rubber hand as the real hand. When the fingers of the rubber hand are bent backward, these individuals fear pain and withdraw the real hand.
Yet few would complain if I took a digital photograph of say the Mona Lisa because it’s obviously not the original. It’s in a different medium. So if I took a digital image off the web and printed it, it’s no longer the same medium, and therefore “not the same”, right?!
It helps that Rob is really on fire throughout the 39 minutes of the album, relying heavily on the screamed lines that he'd reined in for a few of the recent albums. I don't know about you, but while I appreciate the guy's adventurous nature and willingness to experiment and broaden his range to include its depths, I like it best when he's screeching over the iron-clad mesh of the guitars like acid raining from the sky, and we get plenty of that here. The guitar tone is boxy and effective, the leads spurious but entertaining, certainly some of the most acrobatic they'd yet delivered but still mindful of a good dual melody (as in the title track). The bass once again doesn't do much but follow the guitar, yet you can hear a few of his fills, and this was also the most muscular execution yet from Dave Holland, the powerful pounding undercurrent that the band would further exemplify as they blasted into the late 80s with Ram It Down, and of course the inevitable Painkiller.
“However, this fatwa has nothing to do with the reality on the ground, and contains more political absurdity then it does religious guidance. Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi himself is an Egyptian who has Qatari citizenship – given to him after he opposed the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. However, when an Israeli office was opened in Doha, Al-Qaradhawi did not renounce his Qatari nationality. This is a personal issue that does not concern us as much as we are concerned with the usage of religion, especially the weapon of the fatwa, in highly politicized cases.”

Observing the behavior of children supports the truth of this paradox. The joy of children comes from their captivation with the wonders in this world. They have not gazed on the universe as long as we have; therefore, its beauty is still fresh in their eyes. Children delight in playing the same games and hearing the same stories over and over again because they are still enthralled by the beauty of those things. Who would not sustain this sense of delight if he could? Alas, as we grow old we seem to lose something of this delight, despite life being no less beautiful. Our eyes grow dim with age and we no longer see as clearly the rich significance in every starry sky and every blade of grass.

If you’d like to add this look to your wardrobe but need to buy some pieces to make it work, here are my suggestions just for you! Just click on the picture for more details! Give your Wednesday a little attitude!
In the last week, I've bought books by Laura Oldfield Ford, Philip Davenport, John Lanchester, Neil Campbell and others, yet not sure how much time I'll have to read them - or God forbid, write about them as well! Yet, I'm sitting here, with a week off, knowing that I need - for my own sanity; and because its what I do - to add to this stockpile of work, that at best might receive only a silent applause. I applaud those publishers, blogs and magazines that have carved out their own little coterie, their own little audience - its possible that that's enough; that it creates a shape and narrative around diverse work, and, in time, that will feed into the wider culture. Alternatively, it might be that we are all the followers of narrow sects, proclaimers of the true word, gathered together in dimly-lit basements, glad only that our solipsism is cast aside for a night a month, measuring out our achievements with other solipsists, always a little bit fearful (but possibly glad) that someone outside - some black-clad Roman will come and haul us from our self-designed cell and into the light of public testimony or punishment.

There hasn't been too much else going on around here--just our normal every day stuff. J has been making different amigurumi items just about each day. I've been working with the yarn I showed in my last post. It's not an easy yarn to work with though so it's slow going.

Madelyn took the initiative to use Google Images for the animals who eat algae (her topic) and illustrated her report. Note the "!" near the algae--apparently it knows it is on everyone's menu.
Even more hidden was the writing in my head. I felt pressure, like that corked dam. That there were stories to tell. Stories of beauty in a gray world. Stories of hope in suffering. I wrote the words in the journal of my mind, filed away forever.
Today we went to the hospital to pick up Maddy's new orthotics, and let me tell you, she is NOT impressed!! I expected as much - they restrict her movement at the ankle so it is much harder for her to move around. She can still stand with them on but it's a bit more awkward for her. I don't think that she can go from laying to sitting with them on though - she needs more ankle movement for that.
So the great question of life is, “Do I love Christ — am I committed to Him in such a way that I will serve, follow, and obey Him regardless of the cost to me?”

I can vouch for Andrew and confirm that he is a top guy, as well as being a kick ass writer. We were on the same course at Bath Spa and, honestly, if it wasn't for him I definitely, DEFINITELY would never have passed the hellish film module I took in my first year. It was doomed from the start but somehow I managed to pass wtih Andrew's help. Actually, somehow I managed to get two marks off of a first, go figure. So a much delayed, big fat thank you, dude, for arriving at my flat armed with vodka and shit loads of awesome ideas. Or did I supply the vodka? Either way, I've just whisked a copy of Elsa's Reality off to my Kindle and you folks should too. What else could you buy with 77p? 3 and a bit Freddos (remember when they were 10p? I do)? A pint of milk?! I have no idea what milk costs. You know what else you can buy? A YA fantasy short story named Elsa's Reality. Bargain.
We started the day off with a big breakfast, then headed out to play some golf.
Next feature to decide..... how should we be turning this thing on and off? The switch can show up in many places, but typically in one of two. Either on the end cap opposite the lens, or on the body of the flashlight just behind the lens bell (like Granddads flashlight). 'Tactical' flashlights normally have the switch on the end cap, and for good reason. In this placement the user can palm the light, while turning it on and off at will with the thumb; Quickly, easily, almost instinctively. It's an end cap switch that Carteach favors.
You also started rolling over this past month, too! You love tummy time, so you always look a little confused when you roll over from your tummy to your back, as if to say, "uhm, oops. I didn't mean to do that!" Then you kick your little leg up and roll onto your side and look around a while. You are so cute :) We have finally decided that we can stretch out our eating schedule a little! You now can go 4 hours between feedings during the day, and 5 to 6 hours at night! You have been going to bed around 9:00 and will nurse once during the night, then you wake around 8 or 8:30.

Then, the day before we came home reality reared its ugly head. I received two calls on my cell, on from my doctor and one from Goldie's speech therapy provider. I returned the call to my doctor, but decided to wait until we got home to deal with the other one. There's something that just isn't right about being put on hold while you're at the beach. The receptionist was so not impressed when I told her where we were.

Juliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days. The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal. As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.
After the talk, we had a few minutes of lively discussion about a few points of club business. The highlights were:
And Bloomberg could offer a theory about inequality in this country, one that certainly would become controversial should he follow the entreaties of columnist Thomas Friedman and reconsider running for president as an independent.
And after all the effort made the past three days, and the lives lost in service to the planet, the nuclear weapons removed from Santa Monica Bay and Osaka, the destroyed base in Oaxaca, the battles over Turkey and Mexico, and between Mercury and Venus, people still say, “Well, when is it going to happen?” after many good aliens, White Hats, White Dragons, Brethren and Sisters of the White Robe, eliminated many threats…you people still want horror to gratify a base thirst.

One of D&D's most feared, campaign breaking, artifacts is none other than the Deck of Many Things.

Some of them even remove characters completely from the campaign until another high powered piece of magic is put to the task of reversing the harm done.

Through the evening I hear about two men who went to the North Pole in the dead of winter and found open water where it should have been frozen, hence an impending global warming disaster. But they were dauntless explorers as they jumped in the water and swam from pack ice to pack ice.
These are a list of potential possibilities:
Many of these things are already against the law. We have laws against littering, idling, double-parking, and parking in bus stops. Do we really need a permit system to enforce them? Others are just vague and bizarre, like the city should create a pre-crime unit to arrest people before they commit violence. But the biggest complaint people seem to have, according to last year's press release, is that they're messy. Squadron's favorite phrase is that Chinatown is "like the wild west." It's "chaos," Chinatown is being "overrun" with "no clear rules." The proposal would "create a clearer system" that would allow the bus companies to operate "in harmony with the local community."
Yes, Electrikinc is a publication venture, but one with a difference. A small group of Bath Spa graduate children's authors, with some impressive editorial skills between them, have got together as a co-operative to publish their own work. It looks to me like a promising alternative to the pitfalls of self-publication; and crucially one which embraces the advantages of new technology. Kim's book will be first to hit the market - I would say shelves, but of course the name is a bit of a giveaway. Electrikinc will focus on e-publishing and print on demand ... which has led me once again to think about electronic vs. paper books.
I spent two months on outreach with a team in the South Pacific six years ago. We served the people, worked alongside them, played with them, traveled with them, and most of all; learned from them. While I was there, my perspective of ‘normal life’ began to change.

“We mustn’t give the impression that we’ve solved the problem,” he told UN Radio. “What we’ve done is actually reduced the very high levels of mortality and malnutrition which caused so much suffering. And we are now in the position to make even further progress to help people get back to normal lives. But we’ve still quite a long way from a return to normal and secure situations.”

This time around I stayed away from weird foods. Well... Almost...

As parents, we are pretty laid back. We take things as they come and we laugh a lot. We learn new things everyday and we keep the communication as open as possible. Luckily, the girls are pretty mellow. They sleep A LOT and eat A LOT - so the transition into our new life is going smoothly. So far, so good. Don't get me wrong, I still need time for myself - yes, Dustin does drive me crazy as times - but, thats normal, right? :-) We are so thankful to have my parents and his b/c they babysit whenever we need them - which allows us to get away and do whatever we need to do to stay sane. :-)

Good morning! How are you? I hope all is well! If you are curious to know, I did get outside to enjoy working in my garden this week. Although the snow hasn't shown up again, it has been quite a cool week with hard frosts most nights. Hopefully, my flowers took it in stride and I didn't lose any of them. The sun peeked out during the day and it sure felt wonderful! There is nothing better than the sun on your face!

The point is not how difficult the piece, or how great it is. It is love, attention, and prayers that you put into it that matters. I know that every piece I received will be very special, and I really hope that everyone received mine will feel the same.
I started back to work today. It went really well. I had all new evaluations and the paper work is already stacking up. I enjoyed my work, I smiled, I helped, all my patient's are actually pretty cool...(not assholes like they can be), I got to see people I care about. It was a positive day.

Rope is usually described as an interesting experiment that didn’t quite come off, a party line that Granger himself subscribed to. Hitchcock shot in long takes of up to ten minutes, breaking them up mostly by panning into an object that disguises the cut with a brief moment of dark screen.

I think about kids a lot because I work at a hospital; a hospital that only treats kids. A place where there are a lot of kids who are really sick. It makes me think about how many kids there are that aren’t battling cancer, that aren’t going through chemotherapy every other day, but are still slowly decreasing their chances at a healthy life because of the world and society around them.
Sorry, I couldn’t resist “poking the bear”.

At this point, I was checking my email every hour or so. I knew that her mother took her to her house in Elk River, so there was no point in thinking that she was going to be at her apartment anyway. I finally heard back around 7:00 that night that she would check on my stuff the next day when she got back. Since there was nothing to be done about that, I called my phone, figured that if no one was answering it it must be in her apartment because the ringer was on, and left it at that. So another night was spent in Woodbury.
Krishnamurti: What do you mean by its being good for them? Is there not something else one can do to help? What can one do for another when that person is suffering? One can give sympathy and affection. Suppose that I am suffering because I love someone who does not love me in return, and that I happen to be your son. Your prayer will not relieve my suffering. What happens? You discuss the matter with me, but the pain still remains because I want that love. What do you want to do when you see someone suffer whom you love? You want to help; you want to take away the suffering from him. But you cannot, because that suffering is his prison. It is the prison that he himself has created, a prison that you cannot take away – but that does not mean that your attitude should be one of indifference.
Every year she arrives soon after fall, but this time she decided to make us wait. We waited and waited...spent an almost warm Christmas and an exceptionally mild January (heck this season Kolkata had chillier days than London!). We were feeling smug on having given winter a miss. There were signs of an early spring everywhere-- sprouting daffodil bulbs, spring collections out in shops, people wearing light jackets. Spring and love was in the air.

This is what Eagleman explores in the four chapters leading up to this one and he begins with a chapter with a quote from Dark Side of the Moon: ‘There’s Someone in my Head but it’s Not Me.’ (My brain made me play the album twice after reading that chapter.) Beginning here he shows us just how little we know and can trust ourselves. In fact he even demonstrates how consciousness can be an impediment:

The Tachotype makes use of the fact that most syllables start with a consonant, followed by a vowel and end with another consonant. On the left side of the keyboard are the most used consonants, in the middle are the vowels and on the right side another set of consonants. You can type several letters at once, after which the line will go one space down, and a new syllable can be typed. Because Den Outer didn't want to make his keyboard too complicated, he left out some letters, like the "d". In order to type a "d", you have to type "tj". For an example, see Martin (1949), p. 422. The advantage of the Tachotype above other stenotypers is that you actually type real text, and not some kind of code.
It has been plays like this, that have been becoming the topic of discussion in the hockey world. The NHL’s seek-and-destroy mentality amongst players, which has lead to bone-rattling hits and bloody fights, has become the image of the league. While the hitting and the fighting has been popular amongst fans and gets the crowd rocking, much of it has been total nonsense.

I got up this morning and finished my card. Here it is. Our lovely host Sarah Gough has designed a wonderful sketch for you to follow for our challenge this week. I love this sketch and think it will be one that I use again - such pretty layers! I used a bit of my retired (hoarded) Blue Bayou with some Basic Grey DP and a Spellbinders die to create the snowflake. Two different SU sets were used to stamp snowflakes with white craft ink and the tiny snowflakes are from a Martha border punch. The sentiment and the Victorian ornament are from Prairie Fairy and the flower and the crinkle ribbon were hand dyed using Rose Red reinker. Some Rock Candy distress stickles and Crystal Effects finished it off.

Jen and I headed out for dinner, and we ended up at Phil’s Diner, a little restaurant in our neighborhood that’s both new and very old. The restaurant, which is inside a dining car, dates back to 1926, and served North Hollywood for decades and decades, in a few different locations. Then, 12 years ago, it closed, until an enterprising couple bought it, restored it, and opened it up again in a new location about six months ago.

Once we were settled then the feasting began. Kates mum is a fantastic cook and this year decided that we weren't going to have a sit down meal, but lots and lots of nibbles. And believe me, there were a lot. Plate after plate came out, a never ending parade of delights that all looked delicious. The next few hours were lost in a sea of Brie and Cranberry parcels, honey and mustard glazed sausages, tiny Indian and Chinese bites, and many, many more. By the end of it I was half slumped on the sofa, tears of defeat running freely down my cheeks and the meat shakes hitting my body from overindulgence.
I also attached some solid metal castor wheels (as I had always originally intended). Along with the advantage of mobility the wheels also add enough height to give the cabinet perfect proportions for a coffee or deep side table.
Meditation is the art of opening the third eye (inner eye). You become calm, submissive, and assertive and seek stillness. Between every breath, you seek a space that is beyond this world and is somewhat closer to your guardian angel’s world. You will peace in this state of mind. In addition, while you are meditating you are much closer to your god and to your guardian angel as well. In this state of mind you can contact with your guardian angel and even communicate with him.

In 30 states — including Arizona, California, Idaho and Utah — the LDS Church showed the largest percentage gains of any Christian group, Jones noted. Of course, many of these states — Rhode Island, Connecticut and Mississippi, for instance — have relatively tiny Mormon populations, so adding even a small number of members can produce a large jump in percentages.

Anyway, I'm rambling again, so, what else is going on in my life? Well, nothing earth-shatteringly exciting, but there is a chance that I'll be let out of the house on Wednesday, released from my desk, freed from the constraints of the computer to nip down the road to Durham to meet my old friend Sasha for a bit of a catch-up, and maybe a little glass of wine or two. I reckon I deserve a bit of a treat, I haven't had a proper day (or night, come to think of it) out for so long! A ridiculously long time, actually. So, I'm looking forward to it. And hopefully that'll take me mind off this obsessive search for the perfect book title. Hopefully.
By planning ahead (aka--unplanning and or at least planning to be interrupted), I find I am less apt to be frustrated and not caught off guard when he doesn't stick to his sleep or nap schedule, or when he just is more fussy. Heaven forbid he doesn't work like a machine. He's a human after all with constant changing needs. In this day in age where there is so much parenting information, guides and tell-alls I think we often get trapped that our babies should fit the books we read--forgetting that they are individuals. I know I sometimes think to myself when he doesn't sleep through the night "What the heck? We did our routine, we did everything like we normally do...so why isn't he sleeping like he should?" And then I realize I have bad night. I have nights where I don't sleep well. It's funny how we (can I lump anyone in with me, or should i just say I?) sometimes de-humanize our child and think if we do X and Y then we'll always get Z. But that's not the case, and the sooner we let that go, then the more I think we'll be prepared to deal with their changes in behavior. We can't expect them to be perfect or adhere exactly how we want them to, when we ourselves, don't always stick to schedules and constantly change our minds as well!

A couple hours from Tok, around the Tanana State Forest area, we spotted a Moose cow and her calf at the side of the highway. Lynda managed to get this photo of mama, but the calf ran in the opposite direction.We were so excited to see these animals - we had been looking for moose for weeks but only had one other good sighting: the one at the cemetery in Kenai.

Planes, vans and a rickety "ferry" (another, even less sturdy, but mechanically sound long-tail) and we arrived at Si Phan Don. The road from the airport to the "ferry terminal" was paved but poorly macadamised, rolling with unintenional and ignored speed-bumps. The bridge aproaches were typical for the rural areas here - so sudden and steep and obviously made without the road's height in consideration - and the iPodded, sleeping E@L's head hit the ceiling each time.

His first professional gig was the part of a “pickaninny” role in the show “The South Before the War” which toured the northeast. By 1900, he had made his way to New York. The following year, he won a prestigious dance contest at a Brooklyn theatre against a man named Henry Swinton, then considered the best dancer in the business. In the audience were the likes of Eubie Blake and Walker & Williams. He began to work with various partners and rapidly became one of only six African-American acts booked regularly on the Keith circuit. In 1902 he teamed up with a successful comedian named George W. Cooper, laying aside his dancing to become the comic foil for a period of 12 years.

I am a mother to 3 beautiful kids . I am 8 months pregnant and I have a wonderful , loving and hardworking husband . I homeschool my children and am a stay-at-home-mom . My financial contribution is to make sure we don't squander the precious income my husband works so hard for . I prepare and cook twenty-one meals a week on a budget of $60.00 . (Mind you this amount was only $30.00/week when we were trying to get out of debt and we still managed without coupons !) It is possible , just look at what you have , plan your meals , and don't buy superfluous junk foods . If you want treats , bake them, or get them from what is in-season in the produce isle . If you want to go out to eat , make sure you budget for it , and don't make any exceptions .
Klaus, a free-market economist who oversaw a wave of privatization in the 1990s after communism collapsed in his homeland, also said the world was "moving in the wrong direction" in combating the economic crisis.
Don’t confuse this with yesterday’s feature of Reclaiming the Ruins, today’s band is simply called “Ruin“! From Cleveland, Ohio, this band is composed of Chris Schott, Jim Greenfeather, Jesse Greenfeather, Nick Cox, and Tim Parker Shaffer! Jesse took a break to do an interview with us!
The Mango Nectarine is a cross of nectarine “sports.” A “sport” is a naturally-occurring abnormality in fruit trees. Grower David Kamada from Ito Fruit Company said: “We see one sport in every 40 acres of our trees. You may get one branch that throws off a new variety. When we find it in our orchard, we mark it and then try to propagate it to see if it is something worth keeping.” Growing a new variety takes two paths, grafting or budding. In the spring growers can take a bud from a new sport and put it onto a new limb of a tree. Grafting is a similar process which happens when the tree is dormant in winter. The Mango Nectarine is believed to be a cross of two old-variety pale nectarine sports.

I found this recipe on Skinny Jeans Food and was pleasantly surprised at how amazing these little snacks were. I was a bit skeptical about the raw oat thing but they turned out to be one of our new favorite snacks. Sweet, simple and the orange zest really made the flavors POP.

The article then recommends other useful articles on various iPad functions, such as “Page Flips Are Better Than Infinite Scroll”, which lays out the pros and cons of both, but then argues that ultimately the page flip, when kept simple, is better than infinite scroll because it helps one keep their place when reading whereas the infinite scroll one can accidentally lose lose their place.
They were operated on to remove their reproductive organs. The girls were allowed to keep their clitorises more or less intact (although not their vaginas) and the boys were plasty’ed to create the same effect, as closely as surgical techniquest could fashion them. (Which was pretty damn close.)

In short, what a WSI franchise offers you is the security to be able to do what you want even while everyone else is convinced the world is about to end and that the economy will never ever get better. It’s a realistic option for people who aren’t interested in letting other people or circumstances control their decisions.
Some businesses are moving into different geographic markets, helping diversify our U.S.-centric export focus. They’re selling in markets where economies are growing faster than in the U.S. and where our dollar hasn’t appreciated as much. Other companies are taking more “conventional” steps—including aggressive and innovative pricing structures that allow higher revenues at the cost of lower profit margins.
But what is the difference anyway with reading literature on an android compare to the unappealingly sad and cumbersome qualities of reading it on the computer screen, you might ask. Nothing, except that my selling out has come full circle. Yep, I won’t make even excuses for it–reading literature on an android is below the belt. It’s downright tasteless and unforgivable.
I have been noticing while creating over the past few days that I have been stepping outside my box a little bit and have really enjoyed putting different textures, patterns and colors together. It is a ton of fun.
China’s closer neighbours in the East understand the context better. Singapore, which has a majority population of Chinese (many of whom are born in the country of immigrant fore-parents), refer to Mandarin as taught in schools as Hua yu, literally and correctly the Chinese language. In the early days, before the vastly English-speaking Singapore adopts its own national language – which, by the way, is Malay, which together with English, Chinese and Tamil are recognized as the nation’s official languages – Mandarin was also widely known as Guo yu understandably because of the strong cultural roots of Chinese immigrants who knew it as such.
Yard work/projects
Sometimes when I am thinking about my life (what I want it to look like, what I want out of it, who I want in it) I get side tracked and end up trying to recall what I was doing at this time a year ago. I like to compare my current self with my past self and try to find the ways in which I’ve grown and the ways in which I haven’t. I’m not the type to have a traditional handwriting kind of journal; I have made many attempts to keep one, but I always seem to lose interest. Fortunately, with the Internet’s many social media sites, I can still look at myself going back more than 5 years.
Mispronunciations aside (and it’s ree-nuh, in case you were starting to wonder), I grew up very under-appreciative of my name. My name didn’t fit right, but I was a teenager, nothing about me fit right. My sister always tried to shorten it (to reen, yeah, that’s appealing, but if my mother can put up with being called Die instead of Diana, I guess I can muster on under the burden of reen), and my friends tried to hide behind clever nick names: Kit (didn’t catch on), elffy (oh boy, internet inappropriate story there), and of course Sasquatch because I have enormous feet. Nothing stuck. Never did they find a name that worked. To this day I’m not sure if I was relieved or disappointed.

When it’s warm outside, you need to be sure that you’re staying adequately hydrated. However, during warmer days, slower runners completing long distances are at risk of over-hydrating because they’re exposed to the harsh elements for long periods of time and tend to drink more than their body needs. I realized that I was sucking down way too much water. I actually THREW AWAY my water bottle to prevent over-hydration. Sounds completely counter-intuitive, but over-hydration – or hyponatremia – is dangerous and can result in serious bodily damage.

Then yesterday, I found myself in the men's department buying jeans for my son and found what I was looking for: 100% percent cotton denim jeans. Regular jeans. The waist fits, the length is good , and the price was affordable. I'll be the first to admit they look like guys jeans--a little roomy in the thigh, a little wide at the bottom; they're not perfect. But they're straight without being skinny and the right shade of blue and most important, they won't fall down minutes after I put them on.
I finally got the chance to ink up my newest Christmas stamp from LOTV!! She is super cute and I had loads of fun coloring her...specially since I think I'm getting a little better using my new Copics! I've been practicing all week and watching tons of tutorials to get it right...cause I almost thought about giving up, selling my new markers and going back to my Prisma pencils...lol. Also, you will not believe this...I tried many different cardstocks over the week that I had on hand, because some were not allowing me to blend correctly and guess which one works the best for me?? My GP cardstock! It's the cheapest too! I started out with my cardstock from Papertrey Ink and it was just not allowing me to blend very well. The only thing I don't like about the GP is it's pretty thin compared to Papertrey Inks, but it does not tear or feather, so that's a good thing! I'm thinking the GP worked best for me, because it's super smooth!

So I dabbed. And dabbed and dabbed and dabbed. And then I dabbed a little more. I liked it, but I decided it needed a little something extra. For those of you who follow Stellar Junk on Facebook, you *might* remember me complaining about my decision to handpaint white borders on 242 Moroccan "tiles"? Well, this was that project. If I was going to live with this in my house, I didn't want to walk past it every day and get annoyed that I didn't take the time to do it right and to ensure that I would love the finished product.
Hume says, "For as to the notion of external existence, when taken for something specifically different from our perceptions, we have already shown its absurdity" (Treatise 1.4.2, Of scepticism with regard to the senses). Hume is not a skeptic whose empiricism entails codifying Cartesian scepticism as irrefutable. To the contrary, Hume takes the position that Cartesian scepticism is a pseudo-problem. An idea that unifies the Treatise is that, contrary to the rationalists’ assertion that logical proof is the paradigm of knowledge, there are in fact no logical proofs for anything we “know” (and Hume is very much focused, as any good epistemologist should be, on the appropriate conditions for the use of the verb “to know”). To “know” something, for Hume, is to be habituated to have a certain expectation of potential future experiences by the regularities of past experiences.
For several days, I followed an established routine that felt for a while like it was working. I’d sleep late, then get up for about an hour or so to eat a bowl of cereal, read the newspaper and watch SportsCenter highlights, then head back to bed. After waking from this first of many naps that would soon follow, I might run out to the store to pick up a few items, or possibly take out the garbage, or maybe even both. It wasn’t much, but it provided enough personal fulfillment that I could head back to bed again for some reading.

Cyndi and I spent some time at Mexico Beach last week. We would move there in a flash if circumstances made it possible. It’s a beautiful stretch of Florida’s Gulf Coast – largely undeveloped with sugar white sand! Most beachgoers cleared out by 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. and as we walked and watched the sunsets we had long stretches of coast just to ourselves!

At this point, Picard’s acolytes are flying all over the States. One of them, Hugh Dufour, came to my attention when he opened M.Wells, a quirky and crazy popular place that began with erratic hours and did only breakfast and then lunch (I read that lack of liquor license was the hitch on the dinners) and chose a location in an off-kilter corner of Long Island City Queens, NY housed in an old metal diner. As soon as the drooling reviews started pouring in, they closed, adding to the allure (word is there is a steak place in the works).

Whether it is pornography alcohol, drugs, or anything that enslaves you; the only way you will truly be set free is to acquire a new affection. The new affection must be greater than the one that enslaves you. To help understand this, I am riding the shoulders of the Scottish preacher Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847) and his sermon “The Expulsive Power of a New Affection.” Taken from the text 1 John 2:15, “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”

Dickie's institutional theory can be assessed from the definition in Aesthetics: An Introduction: "A work of art in the classificatory sense is 1) an artifact 2) upon which some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld) has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation." On the contrary, what makes something art is the intention of producing art through artifice and technique successfully realised.
Saucony have different types of running shoes for different kinds of feet because each person has different shape of feet. This is very important when you are buying a pair of shoes. You have to consider the pronation of your feet. Basically, there are three types of pronation; overpronation means flat feet, underpronation means high arch and neutral pronation means average arch. This pronation factor is very important in running because the arching in your foot creates the motion control. And the right shoe pronation will most likely protect you from getting foot injury. You have to remember that when it comes to buying a pair of shoes, you have to make sure that you are comfortable with the right kind of shoes for right type of activity.

Of course, someone like her with a rather relaxed grip on her temper, than is usually the case outside certain more secure establishments than this place, can make life a little too interesting for those in their vicinity. At least, it does give us all a chance to keep fit and to develop a more alert state of mind than would otherwise be the case. It is probably for these reasons that her children became so adept at hide and seek… as well as advanced first aid.

Plus, it’s not getting dark till 7:30pm! I wish I had an outdoor kitchen so I could cook outside. I wonder if we could BBQ on our chimnea! I am such a sun fiend!

Criss Cross has been out on DVD for many years now, and the US disc from Universal is an especially strong effort. It offers a near perfect transfer of the film with clarity, sharpness and contrast all at the high end of the scale. My only disappointment comes from the absence of any extra features, bar the theatrical trailer, for such a quality movie. One shouldn’t really complain, in these days of bare bones burn on demand discs, but this film does deserve a commentary track at the very least. Still, we have got an excellent piece of the filmmaker’s art looking great. Criss Cross is a highly rated production that occupies a prominent position in the noir canon, and it has earned that honour. It’s one of those rare films that checks all the boxes and never puts a foot wrong from its dramatic opening until it’s darkly cynical final fade out. Those who are familiar with the picture will know exactly what I’m talking about, and those who are not owe it to themselves to discover this little treasure. This is unquestionably one of the real jewels of film noir.

Oh my goodness, I owe you a big blog post. I've been quite the busy bee. There was a trip to the coast to see the cutest little boys in the world, but the wind was fierce and let's just say there was no outing at the beach for any of us. I've been putting in several shifts at the LBS (that's Local Bead Store for the uninitiated). There was a teaching gig or two. I've had such great students lately, it just warms the cockles of my heart! I did receive my swap beads from Michelle and they are lovely! I'll get a photo up for you soon. And there was a little hospital visit by someone here at home but he's doing fine. It was just a clean-up from last summer's surgery.
One of the places we visited was Berry Pomeroy Castle, it's supposed to be the most haunted castle in the UK, however, in spite of that it's worth a visit!

On the part that I presented the salad it looks a bit disappointing butI love Coraline so it doesn't matter as much, right? I'm sure that Coraline had to deal with similar things at some point in the movie... like how the Other Mother made great pancakes but Coraline isn't into the whole "sew buttons onto my eyes" thing. I don't think I can blame her though, can you? Which character from "Coraline" should I make next? ^^
This was my moment. There was a clear space between the first wave of celebrities and the rest of us. A new uniformed guard and chic Parisienne dressed in black bracing a clipboard between her hip and forearm appeared at the top of the steps.

Many of the court’s rulings have overturned long-standing precedents. While conservatives constantly rail against judges “legislating from the bench,” it is far more common for right-leaning jurists to engage in “judicial activism” than those of a liberal bent. That’s what several studies have concluded. Media Matters offered a run-down of a couple of prominent ones:

As a Methodist minister, it is somewhat ironic to me that one of my Native American ancestors left his tribe in the late 1700s to be taught the faith of the “white men” as he called them. He was later listed in the census as a Methodist “exhorter,” or lay preacher. So even though there was not continuity down to my time (his children joined Baptist churches), I feel some sort of connection with him. And I appreciate his willingness to follow his own path. Maybe that’s his contribution to my genetic heritage.

Its like you have a tic on your arm (I’ve had problems with fleas at my house, but I went with a tic instead for the analogy). Tics are a problem, right? How do you respond to the tic? Do you sit there and talk about it and blog about the tic? “Hey! I have a stupid tic on my arm! Its so tiny and could possibly carry disease! Blah blah blah… Don’t do anything about the tic because it only wants attention…” I’m sure that hurt the tic’s feelings, but he’s not getting off soon. Instead of that, people tend to do something about the tic and get it off..

I’ve only ever encountered one man who was besotted with the female back. He was a quarter Chinese but one-half Welsh, so we can’t draw any conclusions from that. The circus I worked for had hired him as a human cannonball, which meant that his own back was subject to considerable compression. Maybe that’s why he yearned to rub his face against the unspoiled vertebrae of a well-postured woman.

The same reasons I use that kept me from exercising and losing weight are the same reasons that I will use to motivate myself. I just have to look at it in a different perspective: (1) I have managed to be fit before and I can do it again this time. Those moments actually felt good and I want to feel it again. (2) I am a counselor, a teacher, a (non-practicing) nurse, a student, an aspiring entrepreneur, a friend (probably an enemy for others), a daughter, an aunt, a mother (to my three year old daughter), and most especially, I am a wife (to my loving and supportive hubbie). These many roles that I have to play only tells me that I need to be fit and healthy so that I can play it well.
This poem I wrote after a long night of talking but with a heavy heart of thinking. It was a very dark poem which was the personification of what I was feeling at that moment… nothing. This was my best way to describe my inner turmoil and lack of hope for the future.
Celandine is in the poppy family. Along with the pretty flowers of bloodroot, which I would love to have in our yard. The sap contains red latex, which can cause skin and eye irritation. Of course, poppy is also where morphine was derived. In ancient times an herbal preparation was used as an analgesic and sedative. That’s a fun aside, but I would not try it myself.
Easter is one of the most joyous celebrations in the Christian calendar, marking the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
On November 9th, we set up tents in conscious violation of the student code of conduct, in order to try and establish an occupy encampment on campus and to counter growing inequalities on and beyond campus. Because this violated the code, the administration sent in the police to take down the tents. When we linked arms around the encampment, the police treated us as people who were violating the law, and who were refusing to disperse.
Articles like this are great because their comments pages consistently expose the mob mentality.
Then there comes that day of mixed emotions. In 2009 I retired, after nearly seventeen years of headship in three schools. Hard work, yes, but along the way I had worked with some very talented teachers, dedicated support staff and delightful children. These pictures were taken at the Leavers’ Assembly and I can’t show any pupil faces, except in the lovely book they made for me. Of course, they’re hanging on my word, as you can see.

Once again I encourage you to take the time to look at all these verses.
But, you can have more than one of a pet on your account from all Beta reports. Whether that sticks or not remains to be seen. If it does, then some pets will still have appeal but it will be based on what they can do in the pet arena. If they’re labelled a “go-to” pet, then people will want them and they’ll have some value.
If nothing else, I’d at least like to thank Lower Dens for giving me the comedic fodder necessary to write this review. I couldn’t have done it without you guys.
26. Scotland gained independence in 1314, after Robert the Bruce defeated the English army at the Battle of Bannockburn.
Subjugating the women into slavery and the men into slavery as well because let’s face it, it’s a lord of the flies situation. And better you than them. In modern society however, there are laws against sharpening rocks and sticks and subjugating people into slavery therefore one needs to be less direct in their tactical assertion of flirtations and their flirting.
Everyone was gone.
Sunday morning, I rolled out of bed, blurry eyed and slightly dazed. I was sure someone had replaced my head with one of those ovoid watermelons, big as a newborn babe, while I slept. I could hear the mushy, juice soaked flesh sloshing around inside, or was that my brain? After the boys had gone to bed the night before, Hubs had stirred up a seemingly unending line of Moscow mules, to mark the end of a work week so fraught with tension, we were both frazzled by Friday. He makes a mean cocktail, and I did each one justice.

As you know, we have two dogs ~ Jazmine & Pico. They love to go out in our backyard and play together. Well last spring the little schnauzer mutt who lives behind us, saw our dogs playing and she little by little, she inched her way closer and closer to our yard. Before we knew it, Daisy was running around like crazy with our dogs and it's become a daily play date ever since. Now if Daisy isn't out, our dogs will sit at the edge of the property and wait for her. And if our dogs aren't out, Daisy will sit and wait for them. It's so cute! On this beautiful May day, Jazz was waiting & I'm so happy I captured it.

One nice thing about this batch that I hadn't planned on is the temp's. Here in Texas the temp is usually HOT! And because of this I usually keep my fermenter in a water bath covered with a T-Shirt, but it's been cold here lately, so no water bath for the fermentation bucket. I've been able to keep it in the pantry where the temp has been a steady 68 degrees. Nice.

The YSL Vernis À Lèvres (lip laquers, $32 for 0.2 fl oz.) are a curious hybrid of a stain with a gloss with the texture of a sticky liquid lipstick. The glossy stain definitely feels quite peculiar on the lips and make the wearer ponder the mysteries of modern cosmetic chemistry; or it could be just me. My favorite way of applying the stain is to put on a sheer coat and smooth it on the lips with a finger, and then top off with a more generous second coat. The effect is a gorgeous glossy pout that lasts for at least 4 hours in mint condition - I can't really attest to the wear above that, because a girl has to eat. It also lasts reasonably well through nibbling, but a larger meal would require some consequent touch-ups.
I wouldn’t know where to begin if I did.
We finished our visit with an admissions officer, a visit with a professor, and a student-led tour of the campus by about 4 PM, which gave me time for a walk-run on the college's track. I went around and around the track as a group of students (boys and girls) played ultimate frisbee on the artifical-turf football field.

Country singer Riley Jensen would never have returned to her small Missouri hometown if her publicist hadn’t come up with the scheme to tape a Christmas special there. So she never would have known that the man who broke her heart at eighteen—causing her to flee to Nashville—was now a widower with a seven-year-old daughter. Riley has ten years of angst-filled hit songs and Grammy awards to prove she doesn’t need Ethan Kent. But suddenly, she can’t help thinking of all she gave up by running away…
The Golden Globe winning show's intriguing storyline and great ensemble cast has generated a huge following and the designs caused such a stir that Beth decided to create a blog to answer fan questions. It was inevitable that a furniture and accessory line would follow.
At this point, I’m on the downhill. Racing to some big reveals and really pumping up the drama. Wil is in for some surprises.
Not only do these souffles look impressive, they taste wonderful. They are tangy from the Parmesan, with those delicious ribbons of spinach running throughout, and the eggs form a lovely crust on top while being almost impossibly soft inside. I was thrilled with my first souffles, and I do hope you'll give them a try, too. They are so much easier than you think they are!
"Oh, I don't really see it."
“Yup,” I replied. “Power and control.”
The award days were not over yet. Today the primary school held their "Best of the Best Assembly" and I was very proud to sit there and watch my little Kitcat receive her very first Academic achievement award. I thought it as cute how they had a photo of each child projected onto the wall behind the stage as they came up to be presented with their award. Seeing as she is in a Prep/1 composite class, Kitcat's achievement is even more impressive, although not totally unexpected because the teacher has been telling me all year how Kitcat does her Prep work very quickly, then asks to do the Year 1 work and often finishes that even before most of the other Year 1 students. Kitcat also received a $15 book voucher with her certificate, and she is looking forward to going book shopping with me.
What a year! And that's with my having to take time out from reviewing YA fiction from May to September because I was a judge for the Booktrust Teenage Book Prize. Then, once I was reading books that fell outside that time period, I could write about novels again.
The first thing I noticed about the Lansinoh mOmma Bottle was the overall design. It's shaped more like a breast than any other bottle we've encountered. And we've tried more than our fair share over the last few months. The soft, pliable nipple is also more "life-like" than other bottles.
And before you mention Julia Louis-Dreyfus remember this: you don’t see the president ONCE in that show, okay? Effectively, in that world, she IS the president*.
These days, dog owners want quality food and products for their dogs. They also want choices, hence the reason for so many different dog food companies and pet supply stores.
So they learned how to brush them, and how to maintain the bridles and saddles and other stable things. But because of the rain, they didn’t actually ride the horses until Friday. Can you believe it? If we waited for the rain to stop in Vancouver we’d never do anything! Nevertheless, they had a lot of fun, got really muddy, did some facepainting (of the horses too), played games and finally on Friday, got up on a horse! Nicky fell in love with Quechilla and both him and Danika rode her while I documented this auspicious occasion (Nicky’s first ride).
We think landscapes only exist out of the city, but the High Line is proof they don’t have to. We should give high streets over to landscape architects more than retailers. I would like to see town centres become like huge gardens or playgrounds. Give it to the skateboarders and BMX kids – the people they shoo away from these areas – because these are the people who actually know how to use urban areas. We should embrace the dynamism that they bring.

I probably won't run this race again unless I go into it purely for fun, in which case I would just run the half, aka the super fun part. Part of me thinks I would like to run the full again to try and conquer it, but that part of me is stupid so I shall not heed its opinion.
However, although Hans and John agreed with my new assessment (Hans had failed to finish the book), the others felt I was being far too harsh. Doug said that although he could see there were faults with the book, he had been really impressed by its other aspects, and Ann agreed. Trevor and Jenny said they'd really liked it, and all four said that they hadn't at all minded having to read the book slowly and thoughtfully, putting it down to think about the meanings and the connections, and Jenny had been so impressed and touched by one sentence about the nature of grief that she had marked it and read it out. *

Even if FDR didn’t personally write the Haitian constitution, he was surely at least minimally involved given his position and that in “Early 1917: US and Haitian Lawmakers Argue over New Constitution for Haiti”:
When I was eighteen, I went to Exeter to study Ancient History and Archaeology, then did a Masters in Egyptology at Birmingham. After that I lived in Greece for a year working as a teacher. Teaching was okay, but I wasn't sure it was for me, so I tried a number different careers, hoping one would spark my interest. Unfortunately, nothing else much appealed barring writing. However, I did work as an intern in some publishing houses a few years a ago and would like to work as an editor as well as a writer (if anyone would have me!).

Lastly, I shied away from the D3 beta since I have been in on that for a few months now. It sounded as if they had some performance issues, but I’ve no doubt those will be resolved before launch. Diablo 3 is a game best played with friends, and I’m looking forward to trying out the harder difficulty levels.

After about a decade I learned how to agree with my parents on a few things: the beautiful view, the breathtaking sight of one of those mountains covered in eternal snow – indescribable! I still go there and just look at it!! I go there and ski. I love skiing… and sometimes I go up there just to make myself clear once more, how unbelievably powerful God has to be to give us something so beautiful!!
Daring Kitchen is the home of The Daring Bakers and The Daring Cooks. The premise of both groups is to create one recipe each month, given to us by a monthly host. We all create the same exact recipe and then post about it on our personal blogs on a designated date.

For those who would looking to take great pictures without the hassle of hundreds of custom settings, consider getting your hands of the Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP digital camera.
I'm not going to measure my success on how others think of me. The success in my life is reflected by how my family views me. Just like the article above states, my children love me, and they don't care how good I am at braiding hair or baking cakes! They think the world of me. They are smart and they are learning so much every day. That's how I measure my success, teaching them the things they need to know, and loving them. However, they're teaching me more than I'm teaching them!!

Seriously, how often have you berated the disciples for one thing or another? let’s be honest. Friends, we are these men. I had to stop my brain SO MANY TIMES yesterday from wandering down rabbit trails of fear, worry, thinking of tomorrow and planning for the worst..seriously. God, don’t you care that I’m going to the ER again? Jesus cared on that boat on the Sea of Galilee and He cared in my Ford Explorer yesterday and He cares today and always.

"Americans don't know how to dress anymore and I'm here to help them learn how to again!" she said and then handed me the most God awful turquiose dyed denim duster complete with feathers dangling from leather strips that accentuated the southwest designed fabric coming over the shoulders with the finishing detail of copper puffy paint outlining the fabric, just to give it that little extra oomph.
Actually, it turned out perfectly! A partner I had before my current ones (a 20 year old guy) , is starting gym again after quitting at the end of last year. So our coach is going to put us two back together. Because he works as well as going to school, he won’t be able to train the full hours either, so it couldn’t have worked out better!
I had to order this cute little cross stitch pattern. I went through my basket where I keep my embroidery supplies and found this vintage cross stitch fabric, I'm going to make it up using this! I'm going to have to make a stop at the craft store to get my thread and then I'm getting right to this :)

It was actually the Eric Gregory award, to pre-empt your next question. It was all kind of new to me, that I could write – I had come from an Art School background and was 29. You need to be under 30, and I just slipped in the door at the last minute. I don’t tend to enter many competitions – though I did enter the Mslexia the year before last and was commended. Perhaps this should encourage me to enter more…

So, first of all, each real estate deal goes through five stages of its life: due diligence, negotiation, pre-closing, closing and post-closing activities. Simple, isn’t it? But where do paralegals fit? Everywhere…Yes, I know, a paralegal is not involved in the negotiation process. However, who is drafting schedules to contracts most of the time? Who does revisions and prepares riders? You betcha – most of the time, it is you, the paralegal. So, you can’t bring the purchase price down because the property looks like a row of dilapidated shacks after a tornado when a seller insists that he is selling a modern shopping mall, but you can assist your attorney who, in this case, represents a buyer in preparing the contract that is in the best interest of your client, a buyer.
Some have been warning us for years that there are forces within this land which are committed to destroying everything which is great about Great Britain. For a long time they were lonely voices calling to deaf ears, although more recently others, including one time New Labour voters, such as myself, have begun to see the truth in what they are have been telling us, and to appreciate the growing threat which we, as a nation, face.
I'm talking about having lots of kids if they come to you, sending them to college, feeding your ice cream habit, and in general living with what some would consider some sort of crazy risk-taking -- but, once you get used to it, just seems normal and actually gratitude-inducing for how much plenty we encounter all around us!

Ricki Lake continues to be a strong contender for the win – what’s the deal with Derek Hough? What does HE do to get stellar performances from his partners? Mind you, he has been very lucky with his partners in the past… he rarely gets a ‘dud’. Ricki has eprsonality, she has talent and she was in Hairspray…. she’s got the motion of the ocean. This week, she found out that she has a pinched nerve, the doctor make sit sound like she could paralyzed if she coninues… but of course, she perseveres! Another great dance this week from Ricki, she’s making the race tough…
And if you…. or you… look into the seeing stone, you’ll see all you can and so must write. Look back (as we historical novelists do). Look forward. Remember the parable of the talents. With all my head and heart, I wish you success in revealing the ‘then and now’ that makes the study of history so fascinating, and the deep and lasting satisfaction of a serious undertaking, well done.

Jeremy remained crouched in the garbage can seemingly forever, figuring that their cries of “come out Jeremy, come out wherever you are, we’re going home, the game's done” were just a lame ploy to lure him out prematurely. He was eventually found, hungry, shivering and holding a Pogo Ball for warmth. He sat there, in a pile of his own poopies, victorious. He was the clear winner.
He still refuses to ask for mercy. He chose not to appear before the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency earlier this month.

But he has done so. “It is finished.” God will spare the sinner because He did not spare His Son. God can pass by your transgressions because He laid those transgressions upon His only begotten Son nearly two thousand years ago. If you believe in Jesus (that is the point), then your sins were carried away by Him who was the scapegoat for His people. (“All of Grace”)

So what if all food was good for us. I think that would be both a good thing and a bad thing. Knowing that anything we want to eat is healthy we might be tempted more to overeat. Even food that is good for us shouldn’t be eaten in mass quantities beyond what our bodies need. And if its all good for us where is the fun in sneaking a treat – but are there any treats when its all healthy? More things to wonder. On the bright side we could eat what tastes good, like chocolate, any time we want without guilt. We could eat ONLY chocolate if we choose because there is no need to endure foul tasting food. So what happens to the foods that people don’t really like the taste of? They would never be eaten. Don’t you eat certain foods only because you know its good for you? I think alot of people do. I’m sure alot of people only eat vegetables for their health benefits. I do like alot of different vegetables but I choose those I like or, sometimes, the ones that are cheapest because I know I ‘should’ eat some kind of vegetables daily. No more! If I can eat anything I want and get the same health benefits I’ll take cheesecake thank you!

San Sebastián reminded me a lot of Bilbao. When you were walking through the Old Town, it reminded me exactly of Casco Viejo in Bilbao. When you were walking through the newer part of town, it also looked like Bilbao. The only difference is the beach, which is a huge difference. It wasn’t as industrial as Bilbao, but both are beautiful places to visit.
The next night was the wedding. Ex BF Jered was there, which I knew he would be, but I was determined not to say a word to him. As we walked up, he stopped and said hello, and I just mumbled hi as I walked by. I just did not want to have anything at all to do with him, so he couldn't go back and tell his skank girlfriend I was talking to him so she'd text me.

Now, Liesl escaped her audience and plunged so deeply into the music, she no longer sensed if anyone else was there. Except once. After the pounding clash of the first passage, she was midway into a peaceful interlude when she surfaced long enough to dare look into the second row. Gone! He’s gone! But where? No time to wonder; the music wouldn’t wait. The storm was gathering again. It demanded she channel it down the length of the instrument and release it to the room. But in the finale, in the resolution of the strife, the victory of peace prevailed.
There's a compulsive need to make certain your child isn't missing out on anything, and let's face it, it doesn't get any bigger than Christmas. From lights on houses, to friendly customer service people, and of course TV galore, Christmas is everywhere, and your child could easily feel left out.

All told, between the free-form and formalized discussions, this group of eight 5-year-olds spent 40 minutes discussing great paintings. Forty minutes! I was prepared to ditch it at any time, but we kept right on going until I felt I detected the beginnings of restlessness. But come on! That's almost as long as a college-level classroom session on art history, and in our version, no one was dozing off. We never made it to the clipboards.

My favorite Q gadgets? I loved the exploding key ring in The Living Daylights, the wrist-activated blowgun of Moonraker, and the fountain pen filled with acid in Octopussy. And my favorite Q moment came in Licence to Kill. In that film, Q actually goes out into the field to assist 007, who has gone rogue. Now, all through Bond's career, Q has constantly complained that Bond never returns his gadgets in their original working condition. Late in the movie, though, Q is posing as a peasant sweeping a sidewalk when the bad guy drives by. Q alerts Bond via the little radio he has attached to the broomstick...and then, with his job done, he casually tosses the broom aside.

Well this needed to be addressed, so I pulled out after the guy and stopped him just after he went around my other officers and the car that they were pushing. One of those officers had tried to flag him down, but he drove right past that officer, too. I got him to stop about half a block down. Needless to say, I was not in the best of moods when I approached the driver.

“The Paranoid” is taken from IHSAHN’s anticipated fourth solo album. Set for release June 19, Eremita was mixed by Jens Bogren (Opeth) and features performances from drummer Tobias Ornes Andersen (Leprous), saxophonist Jorgen Munkeby (Shining-Norway), guitarist Jeff Loomis (ex-Nevermore), and vocalists Devin Townsend, Einar Solberg (Leprous), and Heidi S. Tveitan (StarofAsh). MetalSucks editor Vince Neilstein says, “The Paranoid” is a perfect introduction to Eremita. It’s heavy, expansive, and it’s complex without being an asshole about it. Not that any of this should be surprising; IHSAHN’s been developing his own singularly definable sound for three albums now, so fans should know what to expect.”
Day off from work today. Came home at 4 in the morning, again. (though it was worth it, chuckles) That's why I took a three-hour nap in the afternoon, which was a baaad idea coz naps always get my head all messed up. They don't really suite me, no no. I've been alone at home for a while now, so there's no mom to cook for me (but I'm not helpless, I do know how to cook, I'm just lazy hah) so haven't been really eating properly. So today when I finally had to eat something, my stomach got all messed up. just wondering: how is that possible?!

I watched President Obama’s short speech from Kabul, Afghanistan yesterday evening and it made me sad. I was expecting good news, and when the president said he was going to tell us how we will complete the mission and end the war in Afghanistan, I got excited because this is what I’d been waiting for. I’ve been waiting for the time when all the soldiers overseas finally come home to their families and no longer have to risk their lives. I’ve been waiting for this news for over a decade and I sat up in anticipation but I didn’t really get too much. It seems that while almost all of our troops will be home by 2014, which is a good thing, it looks like a number of troops will still be in Afghanistan for another 10 years, until 2024, as part of the new Strategic Partnership Agreement acting as military trainers and conducting counter-terrorism operations. Maybe that’s necessary, there are smarter people than me deciding this stuff, but I just wanted to hear that all Americans would be home by the end of 2014.
The morning after I land in Austin, Texas, I borrow a bike and set off in search of Krautrock. I’ve read that Amon Düül II made some interesting disco jams in the mid-nineteen-seventies, and if there’s one place in the continental US where one can find obscure, thirty-year-old, semi-funky German rock, it’s at Waterloo Records.

For their analysis, Laura Hewitson and her colleagues at UP conducted the type of proper safety research on typical childhood vaccination schedules that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) should have conducted — but never has — for such regimens. And what this brave team discovered was groundbreaking, as it completely deconstructs the mainstream myth that vaccines are safe and pose no risk of autism.
This looks and feels like normal thread, and is used as such. However it is conductive – so it doubles as wire. However the main caveat is the resistance – conductive thread has a much higher resistance than normal hook-up wire. For example, measuring a length of around eleven centimetres has a resistance of around 11Ω:

Spencer W. Kimball said, "There is no reason why any women needs to wear a gown because it is the style. We can create at style of our own.... Evening gowns can be most beautiful and modest if they clothe the body. But the Lord never did intend that they should be backless or topless. Now I want to tell you, it is a sin. The Lord abhors it. I do not know what our mothers are thinking of who will let their young daughters wear gowns that are immodest. I repeat again - you do not realize, I am sure, how much temptation you are flaunting before the boys. Now, a woman is most beautiful when her body is clothed and her sweet face is adorned with her lovley hair. She needs no more attractions. Then she is at her best, and men will love her for it.” He continued to say, “On Sinai God wrote on the tablets, 'Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery.' In one breath He said it, and the second is not far behind the first. It is very important that we understand these things, and know the seriousness of it. Jesus gave it to us clearly. He said, ' Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you - That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his

So that is my BIG Whoop, Whoop! for this Friday. I am also thrilled to be finished with 16 New York Beauty blocks that I started a little over a month ago. I have enjoyed the journey, its not totally over yet but there is NO WAY I would have the patience to make a huge number of these blocks... not at this phase of my life. I do really love some of the color combinations I have here and would love to see a whole quilt of them... but I think a wall hanging will do for now! Here is the almost final arrangement, I think... (the color is bad here thanks to the flash but there is little natural light on this cloudy day)

I wish I had stuck around Meshuggah for the party. Supposedly, Delmar exploded when the election was called. Instead, I spent the evening at my mom's house in Dogtown, where my pithy noisemakers were the only sound on the whole street.

I liked this book. I didn’t love this book. And, I don’t think I liked it enough to read it again. I became weary of the many conversations analysing every new piece of evidence: Blomkvist mentions it to Cortez and Eriksson, and then has to tell Figuerola who then must discuss it with her boss and so on. Each time a piece of information is revealed it is mulled over, looked at in a different way, from a different angle…I would skip over entire paragraphs and pages because the content did not change and I found myself not really caring about each character’s opinion.
We had one couple meeting us in Annapolis for the night. We had other friends that had spent the night in Annapolis the night before. We met up with them for lunch and convinced them to stay with us too. Apparently, the boat can fit 6 people for the night (our previous record was 5 people). We have ceramic space heaters so it was warm even outside of the cabin for the two people that had to sleep "upstairs."
Since Juliette has been little she has loved putting popsicle sticks into an empty container and then dumping it out. We keep the container filled with popsicle sticks in the cabinet where she can reach it and she takes it out to play with them often. One day, when Emily wanted to use the popsicle sticks with her and I didn’t have an extra empty container for her to use by herself I decided to turn this fun fine motor activity into a new math game that the girls could play together.
Unfortunately, they only allow pictures of the outside. The doors inside are all painted in gold leaf, which is both intimidating and helps illuminate the palace. The wooden floors of the palace are called “nightingale floors”. When a plank is stepped on, a small wooden piece squeaks against the frame. Thus the guards only had to sit and listen at night.
I didn't have the recipe and I just never ever use enough buttermilk to justify purchasing it because I always end up throwing it out. So I adapted the recipe and here it is below.It's a great low budget recipe as well.
That mutated Ethiopian sound returns with a vengeance in “The Kingdom of Izzness”; I have no idea what this spooky song is about, but you probably ought to take Dr. John seriously when he starts out a tune with “Better move fast and better travel light/ Don’t let nothin’ pass when you’re in the night.”
I became fixated on how I could do this. I had seen my hair in its natural state, when I was a teenager, and thought that if I studied and applied the same techniques as these women, I could manage it and have long, natural hair too.

Hermel went back to persuading Bantum not to touch the plate. Bantum was still quite focused on turning the plate just as he envisioned in his mind. He could hear from the chicken at his feet an almost ethereal sound, “Cluuuuuuuck-cluck-cluck-cluck” very quietly. He so very much wanted to turn the plate he could not resist it. He picked up Dr. Chickenhiemer and began walking toward the cave entrance.
The shops, design and décor of the airport emphasises wealth. Our lay-over was for three hours. The more I sat around doing nothing in the airport terminal, the more I wanted to explore the area. By the time we boarded at 9.00 am, the outside temperature was already 29 degrees.

While the numbers weren’t exactly convincing, we decided that the additional skills I had attained during my 5 years of career exploration would allow me to freelance part-time and still give me 25 hours per week to do my dissertation. A dissertation is one of those things that you can’t work on an hour here or there. You’re either completely immersed for a good block of 5 – 8 hours at a time, or you’re out. Working in the high level positions I had barely allowed me the time to live my life let along write, research, write, research, write… you get the picture. 25 hours is better than zero hours, which was what I’d had before. It doesn’t hurt that this decision coincided with one kid finally finishing daycare (no more bill!) and finally paying off a car. Not driving across town daily would also save us $400/month in gas bills. Picking the kids up after school would save another $400/month in after school care costs. Suddenly, finishing that PhD seemed within reach so we decided to go for it.

This reality explains our perpetual human struggle with weakness of will: why it is easy to have ‘ah-ha’ moments and to make sincere and heartfelt declarations about how we are going to change, but really hard to actually change how we live. The part of us that has the revelation and makes the declaration is not the part that is driving, at least most of the time. In order to change our behavior we must actually retrain the elephant. This can be difficult and time-consuming, but there are methods, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, that the rider can use to successfully retrain the elephant.

According to Genesis 7:10 the gracious God gave them 7 more days to think about it. “And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. I can imagine Noah standing at the door giving one final appeal; “Repent of your evil ways and come into the ark or you will perish.”
I moderate comments on this blog and I’m not going to get into topical discussions on any sites where comments are not moderated. Of course, when I say that X is mansplaining, X might think that he’s just stating obvious truths that I’ve failed to understand. That is why I don’t see how websites with comment sections might breach contentious issues and discuss them productively without an aggressive moderator who, moreover, has to take sides from time to time. And that is why I don’t think that we can have genuinely contentious but still productive exchanges on general purpose websites where no one in particular takes responsibility for the content. A good discussion section on a blog is probably the best we can hope for.
I ignored the flirt. This was a serious conversation. I was trying to avoid a future fight in a dressing room.

Whilst the Chernobyl fund built up over the years will fall somewhat short of the entire costs after the donations this year, it is certainly now getting very close. It will not take much from nations not usually involved in the Chernobyl fund to make up the difference.

“Mmmm…nice touch!” Charles commented. But secretly he was beginning to wish he had never asked to draw her. “Look at her! All ready for a good sex session and now I have to spend God knows how long drawing her instead! Mind you, she wouldn’t be dressed up like this if I hadn’t asked to draw her in the first place…” All these thoughts were going through his head as he sat there staring, pencil in hand, ready to begin. Then his imagination began to go wild as he pictured himself taking her from behind, massaging her smooth, supple ass as he drove his big cock in and out of her wet vagina with the thongs still on, pulling them to one side…

The task is no doubt challenging, so let us turn to Marx for assistance. Among Marxist works on contemporary history such as Class Struggle in France 1848-50, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, Revolution and Counterrevolution in Germany and Civil War in France, the second one, dealing with the counter-revolutionary coup d’état of December 2, 1851, should be most relevant for us. The obvious and huge differences between the French national scenario in mid-19th century and the situation in one state in India in the 21st century notwithstanding, we can profit from the brilliant analysis of how, under what political circumstances, the fruits of popular struggles could be usurped by an upstart-turned autocrat.

This article also says e-book users are more likely to buy than borrow. This, in spite of piracy and DRM and all that. LOL Because book sales are supposed to be down and if ebooks weren’t around, would sales be even more down? Just made me wonder is all.
I am persuaded the apostle was speaking of himself for he referred to this as a revelation in verse 1. In Ephesians 3:3 he wrote, “How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.” He had heard unspeakable words, words that were unlawful for man to utter.

So I was in Ohio two weeks ago, and everybody there was so incredibly nice. Someone I met in San Diego even gave me the bag with my artwork on it that they were giving away at San Diego that I never got at the time. I got asked about my blog, and I feel like I forgot why I started it in the first place. Sure, there's headaches, but ultimately it's about all the people who I meet at shows, and online who are so supportive and positive.
I'm on a diet and I'm doing a very good job of sticking to it. (16 pounds in 6 weeks) We're talking low-carb, low-fat and low-calorie. So I'm eating a lot of cardboard. Being a foodie by nature, this is not easy. Since I can't indulge my taste buds, I'm indulging my eyes. Let's wallow in carbs.
I just listen to all kinds of music. I don't prefer classic or pop-rock!!! I just listen to whatever sounds exciting. I prefer all styles.

Mile 14: Stopped to take off our shoes and enjoy a short nap on some dude's front lawn. Been passed by several 75 year-old ladies, and two pre-teens running with stuffed teddy bears under their arms. Glad I'm not wearing anything that says Army, because Uncle Sam himself might suddenly apparate and rip my stripes of my sleeves for being such a wussy.

"But it's really hard to get into Veterinary Science," I told him, and Dr. Guoqing smiled and said he knew. "It's not the case in China," he said, "a neighbour told me that I'd never find a wife if I did veterinary science, and so I didn't want to do it."

I'm right in between, so it makes it nice that we can have him participate in the program that the school district offers. He's a peer in a Peer Model program and he's doing great. His teacher and the classroom culture there are a perfect fit for him.

What is your timeline/budget? Many people think we designers just sit around all day cleaning our hipster glasses and discussing how much better we are than the common folk, but design takes a lot of time and energy.

"At the time Beth and I married, Karla was in the throes of her disabilities, Bipolar and Borderline Personality disorder, which left her in some ways to struggle with forever being a child herself, subject to whim or sudden changes of heart. Like a balloon adrift on the wind, she would step out to pick something up from the grocery store and not come back for literally a year or more. This is not to diminish Karla as shallow or careless. Karla had an extraordinarily deep and tender soul. Inasmuch as she struggled to breach the threshold of her illnesses, she had a depth of feeling and understanding that was wise many times beyond her years. The pain of birthing children and ultimately having to let them go, to be raised by someone else, gave Karla a depth of insight that few people have on what a privilege it is to be a parent. It was something she ached for. Children, having them, loving them, wanting the best for them were at the core of her being. And though she was always openly thankful to us, it was always her aspiration to break through one day and to recover some of the years of parenting she had missed.
Silent Night
Jesus said, “Whoever desires to save his life shall lose it. If you deny me before me then I will deny you before my Father.” My greatest burden is not losing my job or what people might say about me. My greatest burden is faithfulness. I want to be faithful. I want to see the body of Christ be faithful. I want to see unbelievers come to Christ.

That is why a husband can work for the wife and family, yet the family might still feel unloved and lonely. It is why the prostitutes embrace has nothing to do with affection.

Several witnesses (not just Owens’ sister in the initial TV report) told me and other reporters that at least one of the attackers, a woman, said as she was leaving the scene that “This is justice for Trayvon,” referring to the nationally discussed tragedy in Florida that took a black 17-year-old’s life and led Sharpton to start his usual race-based histrionics and the New Black Panthers to put a bounty on the shooter, George Zimmerman.

“They have tried every finger and thumb, but I don’t know why that machine does not accept any of them. I have done everything that the officers and the machine babu have told me to: scrubbed my hands with soap and water, even applied mustard oil,” says a tearful Mano Devi. The machine babu is the banking correspondent (BC), Rajesh Kumar, appointed by the Bank of India. So every day she has returned empty handed to her home about two km away, let down by the sophisticated technology that was supposed to relieve her of the tedium of going to the nearest branch bank to collect her wages, and losing a working day in the process. The problem for Mano Devi is her fingerprints. Her hands are calloused. Touch her fingers and you can feel the cuts, the hardened skin which is the result of the tough work she is engaged in: breaking stones, picking up heavy material, ploughing and, of course, working in the kitchen.

Hmm, so help me understand this. Here we have a picture book about a bath. A dog. A cowboy. An extended joke about getting clean and its potential hazards for a habitual slob. I will point out that while admittedly, the cowboy has to take his clothes off to bathe (well, don't you?) there is nary a naked rear end visible in this book. Adam Rex has been cleverly circumspect in that matter. The laughs are all drawn from what we can't see.

The path served as a seemingly endless rift between the two forests, it was unnaturally straight, but there was no evidence of a man made aspect to it. The ‘path’ was actually just a clearing that was shaped like a path. Sparse patches of grass dotted the way, but most of it was covered by a thick earth soil.
So, thank you all so much.
I had my first parent/teacher conference today. It was a short conference, just to let us know how Emily is doing in school. Good news!! She is EXCELLENT! Did you have any doubt? She is learning a lot and she is very sociable. I know she is learning because she comes home every day and wants to write and read some more.

in the midst of trying to find a good "cloth diaper safe" rash cream! I try to change him really often if he has a rash and I also sometimes do an extra rinse with my diapers. We have hard water, and the extra rinse/less detergent will help get any extra minerals that might bind to the diapers/detergent out. For awhile I thought he was getting rashes because of the hard water binding to minerals and being left on the diapers, but an extra rinse solved that problem!

From the premise alone, I am repulsed by the couple of millennia in which some people, sometimes thousands of people, have chosen, supported, or allowed as entertainment the slaughtering of humans by humans–or of any creature by any other creature. The Reapers’ response to the riots in District 11 hit home: I grew up in a city whose police shooting water at demonstrators during the civil rights movement. The students from District 1 brought to mind the children from Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo who have been turned into killing machines.

Monday I ran nine miles while we were at my parents' house. Usually I run around their area, weaving in and out of neighborhoods, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of all that weaving. So I opted to run on the busier streets. I think I preferred it, but it sure as heck took quite a while to get through all the intersections. I also took a walk break shortly after the 8th mile. Ended up finishing with a 9:16 pace.

Only by pious acts can one be allowed to get good wealth, good education and beautiful features.

My kids accept me. They know I can be a little air-heady and I lose my scissors ALL the time. They know when they see me standing in the middle of the room looking around that I have put something down and have no clue where it is. They just smile and ask what I lost this time. They know that most mornings I am happy and glad to be there. They know not to test me when it comes to talking during tests. They know my expectations... and I honestly believe they appreciate that they are set high.
Before I start in on this wonderful recipe, I wanted to let you guys know that for the next couple/few weeks, until everything calms down, I may only be doing one or two posts a week. So don't worry, I'm not ditching you, I'm just going to focus on enjoying friends and family for the holidays!

Since my insurance doesn’t pay for massage therapy, I ran out of money before my stiff neck capitulated to positive thinking, and now I had to factor in the physical evidence in my own body of realism’s insufficiency as a treatment modality, along with that nagging evidence of the studies showing that positive thinking is, well…positive.

I began my day by waking up early (shocking, considering I am anything BUT a morning person, especially on Mondays!) to see the Duggar family on the Today Show. I was hoping for a new baby announcement from Josh and Anna seeing as how it's been almost a year since little Michael James was born, but I guessed wrong. I was a little disappointed, but I suppose I'll get over it. ;)

I picked it up and started reading. And found that I couldn't put it down. Zombies play a huge role in this book. The things that happen couldn't happen without them. And yet, somehow, the novel isn't really about zombies. It is a YA book. It has the structures and concerns of many YA books. And it is a stand-out YA.
“My Grandma Peg used to bring me here,” she whispered, as she opened the ornate wooden door to the converted Victorian. A little bell jingled, and we entered a world of heady aromas. Sweet teas, a lingering touch of sage, spices, perfumes…The Lavender House had a bit of everything from cooking herbs and spices to teas and essential oils. I wandered around within earshot while Marlene marched to the old wooden counter.

Biodiversity conservation has thus become a global concern. These conservation strategies involve the preservation of the land and water bodies, controlling the destruction of forests, restricting pollution levels in the rivers and the seas, maintaining the natural habitat of the animals and birds, the preservation of the native species of the land and introduction of missing or endangered species. Often gene banks are created where diverse genetic material is collected. This is then introduced into the natural habitat as and when appropriate.
My grandmother is an example of someone who was left unable to talk and walk well after a large left MCA stroke. It has been a long road of recovery. She will never be fully able to speak again or move well on her own, but, she IS living on her own again (with help from my mom and her friends!). She is still an amazing person, and she is still the same person even if she can’t express it. You can just tell, the way she may roll her eyes at something you say or just shakes her head, or the way her voice gets really excited when you are able to piece together what she is trying to say.
I first read "The Dead" in high school, and as I picked it up again recently I remembered one scene clearly. It's when Gabriel Conroy is looking up the stairs at his wife, Gretta, who has paused on the landing to listen to music being played in another room. I remembered the "panels of her skirt" and the atmosphere of that moment - a woman arrested by music and memory, observed by her husband, who is oblivious to everything but his own feelings of desire and tender possessiveness at the sight of her. He doesn't consider what her own thoughts might be.

Hi Mum!
It was actually Aaron's idea to go skating. He originally wanted to go ice skating, but Kasoma quickly shot that idea down! The last time we went ice skating, he hurt his wrist when he fell and he was willing to chance that again, lol. So he suggested roller skating instead, and that made everybody happy ;)
With the fabrics washed, dried, and pressed, I was able to cut out the bodice and mark all the markings. I used the old fashioned tracing wheel and tracing paper. I like this method, because the markings are faint and don’t show through to the front side of fabric like fabric markers do. And it is extremely accurate. Using a ruler to guide your tracing wheel also helps to make accurate dart lines–all 6 of them for this dress. Because I traced the pattern onto Swedish tracing paper, the tracing wheel does less damage to the pattern piece, in case I want or need to use it again.
I had these fabrics already all cut up into 6"x6" squares! Can someone tell me why they have been put away all these years!? I didn't have a rotatory cutter back then and used a scissor to cut them up at the time. It is fun to look at all these unevenly cut squares :)

What I didn’t know was that the end of this river was about to be a huge waterfall and I was headed straight for it. My best friend in the world scheduled a gyno appointment because she has had a few minute issues. We went and I sat in the waiting room cramming homework in (as I do with most of my “free” time.) What I didn’t realize or expect was Tiff, typically stronger than stone, to come out fighting tears saying “We have to get out of here”. We stepped outside the office and she explained that they found a 10cm tumor in her ovary.

However, the mind of your average mad scientist works differently than most people. The desire to insert things into places that weren't meant to have things inserted into them seems to consume the entirety of their being. After dismounting his female zombie (he pleasured himself utilizing her abdominal wound as a makeshift vagina), Baron Frankenstein says to Otto, "to know death, you have to fuck life in the gallbladder." Briefly removing the modesty patch that covers her actual vagina, as if to say, I have no interest in this puckered mound of opulent flesh, Otto, imitating his master, begins caressing the stitches that snake seductively along the female zombie's succulent stomach with his tongue. Once his misguided attempt at foreplay is over, he's ready to pierce her wound. Of course, all doesn't go as planned (he's not as experienced as the Baron when it comes to performing gash-based cunnilingus), and the dumbfounded lab assistant has nothing but a floor covered with vital organs to show for his oral trouble.

A few generations before our own, journalism could still be viewed as an honourable trade, when reporter still viewed their roles as seekers of truth and exposers of wrong doing. There is now no honour left in their murky trade. The truth is now the very last thing they seek and facts are not exposed, they are spun to suit an agenda or to act as modern fables essential to the ongoing indoctrination.

If Saturday evenings brings "soul flu" to this pastor, Sunday brings healing. It's amazing to me the relief and joy that I feel the moment I'm with the people from our congregation.

Lover and I had been planning our getaway for a LONG time as we hadn't been able to see each other for a while. Hotel booked, flight arrangements made, appropriate plans shared with family members, restaurants picked ... box of toys and lube shipped to hotel in advance ... all was set and as the days drew near, he and I were close to the edge of insanity. Our conversations were erotic, our texts full of teasing promises right up until we met in our hotel room. I had arrived earlier and had time to go out and pick up our traditional first night requirements – champagne, yummy cheeses and pate along with fresh bread. I raced back to the hotel, found some ice and quickly stripped out of my yoga pants and t-shirt to put on a white lace thong and white lace bra. I had just returned from a tropical climate where I had been outside in a bathing suit quite a bit so I was tan from head to toe and I knew he loved this skimpy lacey outfit. Finally I heard noises coming outside the room and the door opened. There he was standing in front of me, tall, lean and smiling a devilish smile. I greeted him in my hotel robe and lace outfit and he pulled me in close slipping his hand underneath my robe to hug me as he felt my tingling skin. We kissed long and deep and parted to look into each others’ eyes and say “Hello.”

I remember driving home that afternoon with my head in a fog, and when I got home I just hugged Jenny and held her for the longest time and promised her that everything would be okay. She needed to hear me say that. I needed to hear me say that too. I'm not sure whether or not either of us believed it, but we both needed to hear me say it. It was the day before Laura's second birthday, and we were both wondering what kind of world lay in store for her.

Whenever we are going to be gone for more than 5 days or so, I stop cooking and do a refrigerator clean out. I have to say, cleaning the refrigerator is one of my least favorite household chores so most of the time I try to wipe it down as we go along, but every now and then it needs a good cleaning. As of today it's pretty empty so that will make this disagreeable chore easier, even though I will also use this opportunity to go through all the condiments and miscellaneous jars of stuff that somehow get pushed to the back and die there. In the end I'll be glad I spent the time to do this as it's nice to come home, open it up, and see it sparkling and ready to fill again.

The OSHA certification requires employers to certify that each operator of a unit is trained and evaluated to meet the safety requirement standards as set by OSHA regulations. The assessment and OSHA certification is done by an approved and qualified agency. The training and evaluation should include a lecture, practical demonstration through videos and interactive computer instruction. Employers are required by the regulation to verify whether the employee has received proper training. They are evaluated every three years to make sure that the abilities are as sharp as ever.

An acquaintance on Facebook recently posted a link that states for the 2011-2012 school year, Walmart will feed every child that attends a Dallas Public School a free breakfast. The initiative is called "Breakfast in the Classroom". The Dallas Independent School District (DISD) is one of only 5 major school districts in the country chosen to share a 3 million dollar Walmart Foundation Grant that funds the program. The link above lists a myriad of reasons why a good breakfast is so important to a student's productivity in school, and I agree wholeheartedly with every one.

To be clear there is not and has never been anything emotional between Mr. Basketball and me. It was purely phyiscal. I’ve never been attracted to his face and he simply isn’t someone that I can converse with for hours upon hours. In fact, it’s never been the case with anyone that I’ve gotten closer to to spite my current relationship. I’ve never cheated emotionally, only physically. I’m not saying that any of this made it OK, it was wrong and I realize that but it brings me to the point I’m about to make.

II. Material and Formal Requirements for an Application As a consequence of the CJEU decision in Case C-322/10 Medeva, for the first time it is possible to file an application for an SPC for a product which is different from the product for which the underlying Marketing Authorisation has been granted. The court decided there that an SPC can be granted for a combination of two compounds, if a Marketing Authorisation is presented which has been granted for more than two compounds. Subsequently Case C 422/10 Georgetown University clarified that an SPC can be granted even for one single compound if a Marketing Authorisation is presented which is directed to more than one compound. The term “specified” used in this decision caused further discussion regarding the questions, how the product of an SPC has to be defined in the basic patent. However, it is very likely that this issue will be the subject matter of a further Referral to the CJEU. Moreover, the special case of passive certificates, i.e. certificates based on third parties Marketing Authorisations, was discussed (Article 6,

They quickly reverse and return to where they came from. Rather hilariously one extra playing a Roman is so shocked by the disappearance of the Ambulance that he seems to forget to close his mouth for quite some time. The Doctor deduces that they have driven through a barrier to another time zone. He uses a grenade to blow open a safe in Smythe's office and inside they find a map of the different time zones which appear to include: Roman, Greek, Crimean War, First World War, Peninsular War, American Civil War, Mexican Civil War, English Civil War, Thirty-Years War, Boer War, and Russo-Japanese War.
In Felt by emerging painter Deirdre Baugh, color reigns supreme. Baugh’s work represents an immediate departure from reality in its depiction, with the artist intentionally abandoning form and structure for large scale abstract expressionist works on canvas. A play on the emotive qualities of color and language, quick gestural strokes move fast across the canvas and handwritten words appear on the surface. Loosely stacked lines float horizontally and vertically over layers of brightly colored backgrounds – evoking a sense of excitement and intensity.
Now this is a good basic cookbook. It is perfect for beginners but also for seasoned cooks who like to keep a reference book on food on the shelf. What I like about this book is that it explains how to select, store, and prepare everything from herbs to meat. There are recipes included throughout, but this book is more about the food itself and the community which produces it. Stories about the producers and the people involved in bringing the food to the Bi-Rite Market also make the book seem very familiar. This is an amazing book, and I think it is a book everyone should keep on their bookshelf. It will quickly become your most used cookbook, I bet.

The parish church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and was consecrated about the year 1050. It is thought that it was built on the site of an even earlier Christian meeting place marked by a standing cross, a fragment of which is under the church pulpit. St Mary’s has the tallest Saxon tower in the Tyne Valley. The building has three distinct architectural styles - a Saxon tower, a Norman doorway and early English Nave and Chancel. The registers date from 1679. Part of the former vicarage, located to the south of the church, dates from around 1378.

Why am I telling you all of this? Because as I have gotten older, I have had so many friends with the exact same problem. And, it is often a point of contention in their homes. As their husbands age they seem to want more sleep and as the women age they seem to need less and less - or at least in long stretches. Many of them find that a twenty minute nap in the afternoon seems to do wonders to refresh them if they are lagging. Is this abnormal, as our husbands say? Are we all sleep deprived as they think? Or is is just a part of aging that people who tend to be night owls become more so as they get older? I don't know, but I do know that lying in bed for hours and hours without going to sleep in not productive, nor does it contribute to a happy home. Staying up until I am tired, then going to bed and sleeping well until I wake up naturally (usually around 6 or 6:30 AM) works for me. And I know that my mother was the same way. She would go to bed, but was often still awake reading at 1 or 2 in the morning. Maybe it is hereditary!
Second, my goal was to encourage the interaction. I wanted to learn more about the people in my life. The ones that I update year after year with news of the happenings in my home. The people I share my life with, whether I see them daily or haven’t seen them in years. Though I know many of them intimately and we have close bonds, I wanted to know more about them creatively. For me, the learning is fun and meaningful.

Their furniture is perfect for apartment living and life with small kids. The sofa we have has a white cover, but we can remove the cover easily and wash it.

2) Distilling each talk into one takeaway
Troll Fell was originally written as a stand-alone. I didn’t know if it would even find a publisher, so there was no point in daydreaming about a trilogy! Then, when HarperCollins asked me for a sequel – and a third after that – I discovered myself writing a trilogy after all. And the books got darker and stronger as I went along. There were threads running through all three – the same characters, obviously, though I added new ones in each book as Peer and Hilde grew older and had more adventures – but also threads of self-discovery, and the longing to travel far away to distant lands. And – of course – romance. It was clear to me even in the first book that Peer was going to fall in love with Hilde. It was a lot less clear that she would feel the same way about him. Indeed, even in Book 1, there’s a handsome fisherman, Arne, who is an obvious rival for Hilde’s affections. The path of true love never did run smooth, and Peer and Hilde have an awful lot to face, and to discover about themselves and others, before they really come to know their own hearts. How lucky I was to be able to follow them for three whole books and discover what happens….

Still casual-oriented, but with a twist, not to mention a few multi-tasking pieces that can be dressed up or down (the jeans, shorts and flats for instance). If you keep up with the trends, you'll recognise a few pieces of this year's Fashion Against AIDS collection from H&M that hits the stores later this week and that got me suprisingly excited. I love that they combined the festival spirit with some graphic designs and neon colours (basically anymore trendy and you die) - I just hope that the mens' t-shirts fit me well enough to grab them.
Loki’s a great character, and different writers have set him against Thor in different ways. Sometimes he’s the grand manipulator. Sometimes he’s the catalyst of disaster. Sometimes he gets his hands dirty and fights. He’s funny and charming, like Milton’s Lucifer, only less predictable. He’s sometimes even a hero. Here he’s as glum as everybody else.
And in teaching my children, I want them growing up with their motivation being their love of God. One suggestion from the Bible Study is to teach them WHY they are being corrected. Instead of just, "Don't hit your brother," give them the reason why we don't hit. And when they learn the reason, they will begin to do things because it's the right thing to do....because they have been taught why it is the right thing.

The information she quotes from is factual. GSUSA did perform a study several years ago about the benefits of an all girl organization. Their findings are every bit as true for a transgirl as they are for any other. Perhaps, even more true. Being around other girls as she attempts to form her own identity as a girl can only be beneficial for that 7-year-old. Her fellow scouts will benefit as well.
Does this mean we are on a terrifying downward spiral, into an abyss of accelerating degeneracy and dysfunction, with no end in sight? No it does not. What it means is that the boundaries are being pushed to ever increasing levels of insanity, until a cosmic global reaction takes place. Portions of this are taking place at this very moment. That portion of the awakening populations are pushing back and will soon be joined by a much larger mass of their fellows, as conditions make their lives more and more unlivable and more and more dire. It is a matter of time and we are in that time frame.

Turns out her contractions started pretty fast after she arrived!

As you all know I'm a massive fan of book covers and I regularly post up lists of my favourites that fit into certain themes. I know we're not supposed to judge a book by its cover but, pshhh, we all do. It's impossible not to notice a gorgeous cover when browsing the shelves of a book store and a great cover design can definitely do wonders for a book.

This fel dabbling did indeed arouse the interest of the Burning Legion once more, and the Blood Elves served these evil masters much like the Drow serve Lloth. The problem with masters of a chaotic nature is these beings tend to revel in conflict and destruction more than the prosperity of their followers. Sargeras is not as interested in followers as he is in destroying every world and living thing created by the Titans. The Blood Elves were too lost in their addiction to realize the evil they unleashed upon the world and willingly served.

For those of you who have been reading this for a while now, you’ll have read my thoughts at various stages over the second half of my PhD in Classics. From start to submission last November it took just on 4.5 years, about average for a thesis in the Humanities. It felt much longer than that I can assure you. Well, the good news is that yesterday I got the letter I was waiting for saying that it had passed. A PhD thesis is marked by two anonymous examiners and one of them had wanted revisions so this letter confirmed that the revisions had been accepted. The examination itself took about 9 months in all and for the last few weeks I had been checking the mail eagerly anticipating this letter.
I wonder about stepping on her cracks. She proceeds this thought with the allowance I will fill the gaps on my own. She allows that she is weak at times and in certain areas. She allows my own life to fill her here, to grow there to feed others in her space. She allows this growth to remain an anonymous group of caterpillars, fuzzy little apartment dwellers that she will pick up when she is good and ready. She doesn’t give them their anonymity, but she will help the chrysalis form with my guidance. She will provide the sustenance, but allow me to do the work to create the photosynthesis that will feed the fuzzies. She knows this is a circle. She knows it is complex. She’ll never need. But she will always want more.
Emily had her surgery on April 20th. She was born with cyst on her neck. It was nothing serious but the doctors wanted to have it removed between 1 and 2 years of age. So finally after talking about this for 19 months it was the day. We were a little nervous or as Dustin had a good word "uncomfortable." There is just something about your baby girl in the hospital awaiting surgery. She couldn't eat anything until her surgery (at 11:15ish.) But she was good as we could have asked her to be. It went really smooth and she did great. They had to remove more cartilage than they were expecting but he said nothing still too severe. And the little stinker wasn't even sore or you couldn't even tell anything was wrong the next day. She recovered amazingly. I thought for sure her neck would be sore or something and I couldn't tell a thing. So we are glad that's over and we are extremely thankful for such healthy kids. Our little cyst ordeal is NOTHING compared to what others have to go through. I just can't image. Emily hasn't ever even been to the dr for anything other than a well child visit and she hasn't even had a band-aid! We are so incredibly blessed.

These are my regular customers, twice a day they line up and watch me fill their dog bowls, once filled they each go to their respective spots and wait for me to place the bowl down. We each have a routine before I put the bowl down, Presley sits and waits until I tell her o.k. and then she gets a big hug, Cody runs to his red carpet, sits and waits for me to give him a big kiss and scratch his chin and Sparky speaks and spins then sits and waits for a kiss.
(That said, I did bump into a creative director who lost his job because I got the agency to pay for a national poster campaign that had a less-than-perfect line break in the legals, but he was fine about it. Well, he didn't say much, to be honest, apart from some stuff about his wife and an operation and losing the house and divorce and rehab, but from inside my BMW, he seemed fine. Sorry - when I say 'bumped into' I mean 'ran over'. Should have made that clear.)

Arabic numbers are written from left to right, like in English. So when there is written Arabic text with numbers inserted into the text, the words read from right to left, but the numbers read the opposite way! Help!!! Plus some of the Arabic numbers are similar looking to English numbers, but some of those are totally different numbers. Interestingly enough, true Arabic numbers are what is used in the US. In Arabia, the numbers actually come from Hindu/Indian!
I worked in my bedroom all day and left the dogs both free ranging it because we haven't had any problems, but when I went downstairs in preparation to pick up the kids I found a fairly good-sized pool of pee (THE BOXER), but I wasn't mad instead I felt bad because clearly it was my fault for not paying attention and letting her out...blah blah blah...I proceeded towards the papertowels only to glance into the dining room to see two small pools of pee (PUPPY PEE)...so I am thinking to myself or maybe even talking out loud to the voices in my head, "Dang, they both had to go out! BAD MOMMY!!" So, I headed towards the two smaller pools of pee, but when I got to them I found an entire minefield of pee puddles!!! Some of the pools were bigger (BOXER)some were just barely puddles (PUPPY). WTF??? Thankfully, we have hardwood floors. Needless to say both are in the doghouse today. Figuratively of course! Puppy is now confined to my bedroom with me while kitty is freerange for the first time in 3 weeks. I have switched to a babygate as my newest attempt to continue separating and acclimating the two...and the BOXER? What BOXER?? Just kidding...she's still here too.

It sounded as though Kirsty was a bit sick of her black separates as so many women are and sometimes you just have to ring the changes, so I decided to include some navy into her wardrobe as it is often a far more flattering colour to wear. I am loving orange this season and it looks great with a tan as well as the tan accessories I have chosen to complete her looks. I have included some gold costume jewellery as Kirsty struggles with accessorising her outfits, I decided to stick with gold tones as they work well with orange and are easy to wear until she gains more confidence. I have also included a lightweight summer scarf, a great way to bring her looks together. When faced with a capsule wardrobe challenge I always try to choose everything from a department store to cut delivery costs, so all the clothes featured are available from John Lewis who stock a large range of brands as well as their own quality collections and offer free standard delivery if you spend over £30.
Put the sugarcube on a paper napkin or bit of kitchen roll before dropping the Bitters onto it - I find that if you lob the sugar in the glass first, it's all too easy to end up with a great, overpowering lug of Angostura. Drop it into a champagne flute and add 2 teaspoons of Remy Martin and one of Grand Marnier. Top up with Laurent Perrier (Claridges house champagne), and then pare a slice of orange peel over the glass so the oil adds a tiny hint of citrus.

So for not a great deal of outlay, I have ended up with a fretless bass that even guitar players can play and still sound like passable bass players. I also now have a way to generate those gorgeous, lush, evocative bass parts, with some semblance of facility. I didn’t have to futz around for hours with pliers, epoxy and sand paper. And I can play in tune…just about.
Tchividjian begins by explaining the inner struggle he had over his own identity during his first year at Coral Ridge:
Sometimes I get into a bit of a pickle and this is what’s happening at the moment. Of late my sleep has been broken and my mood lower. I was feeling very well and decreased my medication – this was a perfectly natural thing to do. Unfortunately as a result of this decrease in medication, I have experienced a lower mood and an increase in anxiety. To help me deal with this low mood and anxiety I have restored my medication to its full dose and increased my daily mindfulness practice. Living with the memories that I do have is difficult but not impossible. To help me cope I have taken short cuts – it is easier to think and talk in terms of worms rather than face, acknowledge and accept the full reality of the abuse.
Google is NOT the place to look for a publisher. Think about your goals: If your main goal is to get a book published and actually see it in Barnes & Noble, then go to Barnes & Noble. (No, I'm not speaking metaphorically. I literally mean: just go there. It's the least you can do if this is your big goal.)

Marvin is a paraplegic. He lost the use of his legs in a motorcycle accident just a few blocks from his home. He has been volunteering as a diver at the Aquarium, where he helps to clean the tanks twice a month. He cannot do this alone. He is required to have two other divers in the tank with him while he is there. In this photo you can see the lift that was put in place to help him get his gear into the tank. You can see him operating it here.
As of Monday, MOH and I have been sticking to putting the kids down at 8:30. This has been a real lifesaver for me because I can get most of my work done before midnight now. (This is prepping notes for the next day at school and stuff like that.) If I keep being this productive I might actually get the taxes done early this year. Not holding my breath though.
The Quebec report takes a purely utilitarian approach to the euthanasia question. In the committee’s estimation, legalizing euthanasia will do more good than harm – and that justifies allowing it.

Those with some jeans, black pants, black skirt, black boots, my Lucchese cowboy boots, some fabulous jewelry, something colorful, something funky and something sparkly, and there is my packing routine. Lately, in fact, I don't pack enough stuff. I've come full circle from packing too much to carry to fitting it all in a backpack. It's kind of freeing, but it also makes me wonder why do I have such a huge wardrobe if I wear the same damn stuff every day?

Take a meter reading to determine what your exposure should be. On my camera, I set focus to manual and switch to aperture priority and half press the shutter release. The camera will then display the exposure. Alternatively, you could use a light meter and get your meter reading.

Have you guys made any good recipes lately? Any suggestions for one I can try for my next battle in the kitchen?
Cloudwine Cellars is, by their own definition, a ‘fiercely independent wine merchant’ and is one which does a particularly good sideline in craft, independent and other hard-to-get beers as well. As a beer lover I guess I might describe it as ‘a gold mine of very fine beers in a beautifully presented retail environment staffed by blokes who know what they’re talking about and know that it is the customer who pays their wages and who also apparently stock some nice wine as well’. But that’s a bit hard to fit on a business card.
It also seems odd that I would feel this way just when things are going well for me. I have a job now, and I have my vision restored. I was very happy for a few days and now, after the novelty is gone, I find some old patterns reemerging. I am posting this to be of help with other people with the same melancholy. Working at a job where you need to be upbeat and cheerful, full of energy and able to work well as part of a team has it’s dangers. If you don’t have much of a life otherwise, you can develop too great an attachment to your job and your coworkers. I posted something about how coworkers are not your friends and how you shouldn’t expect too much from your coworkers or boss. I deleted it because I didn’t want to hurt the feelings of anyone I worked with. But I think they understand this as well. It takes a special skill to ‘turn it on’ so to speak and be pleasant and professional in spite of whatever personal feelings you might have. I am not sure I have it. I can do that to an easier extent with customers than with coworkers. Sometimes my true self comes through a bit when I am around the same people day after day. But I am much much much better at social skills and customer service now than at any time in the past. I can be pretty good at it. This is why I am concerned about this sudden despondency. I could tell my boss detected something when she thanked me at the end of the day today. I didn’t return her sparkling smile right away, although I did smile. It just wasn’t ‘on’, just like that. Again I need to remind myself to be ‘on’ when at work, and use my social skill. You can’t really be yourself if you are involved in sales of any kind. Nobody wants to be around that, they want and need an upbeat, smiling environment in order to deal with their own stress and melancholy. And certainly for the customer, I want to provide a fun experience. So I will find a way to perk myself up again. I know I have people that care about me and want to see me succeed. Feelings that I don’t belong or that I can’t cut it cannot be a part of my self talk or I will sabotage all my best efforts. This is a challenge for me, because customarily, in the past, I haven’t had to step up to quite as much of an extent. But I have gotten pretty good at all these things. I am reasonably confident that I can be that good again, and get even better at my job.
UPDATE: Bible Version Question: I researched various translations as much as possible, although the sheer amount of opinion on the subject is a mite overwhelming. To the best of my knowledge, the ESV and NIV were both translated from the original Hebrew and Greek, so I plan on using them (although I’ll be reading them online, so I may do some comparison with several different versions). My understanding is that the Apocrypha was in the KJV until the late 1800s, or early 1900s. Do you include them in your Bible? Why or why not? Which version do you prefer?

Time......sometimes I look in the mirror, and wonder "When did I get so old?" There are days I just feel my age in my bones. It seems like just yesterday I was in college the first time....or picking Chad up out of his crib. Where has it all gone?? How does it slip by so fast?? I guess if I had the answer to that, I would be a very rich woman. Doesn't keep me from asking though. This past weekend, Mike and I celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary! It has been a long 17 years, and we've had some good times as well as bad.....but I don't think I would trade them in for anything!

In the short term, it would be great if my membership with the gym helped me tone my body (swimsuit season is coming up rather soon.) More importantly, however, I am hoping that this experience will encourage me to continue a lifelong commitment to my own health and physical fitness. As terribly cheesy as it sounds, I am actually excited to monitor my development as I continue to work out. This is certainly a new challenge for me, but I look forward to developing new fitness skills for a healthier life.

This weekend I've been busy answering emails from children in FOREST OF GALTRES PRIMARY SCHOOL, near York, which I visited not too long ago. They tell me they are going to have a new school library soon - but where will it be? The one I recall was in a small room-and-also-corridor so maybe this will have more space? Hope I find out sometime.

He had a government to organize, economic relationships to maintain, workers and soldiers and citizens to satisfy. Solomon had no experience or training; he was twenty years old.

Today is DAUGHTER’S 17th birthday and I can’t speak to her and wish her a happy birthday or tell her how much I love her. I want to make sure you recognize that this is SOLELY your choice and she speaks to others about how much she is hurt because she can’t speak to her father on her birthday. I’ve included just my family in this email because any one of them can tell you their experience with the girls and the pain and anger the girls have expressed to them, as well as testify to the fact that I seek only one thing; unfettered time with my children. They could tell you that everything I do in my life is for the 3 children I have and love more than life itself.

You may be aware that nothing is done on a small scale in the States and in keeping with that Herculean sense of bigness the GABF is the GBBF super-sized. And I’m not just talking about the festival itself, but also the judging. The sheer level of professionalism at the GABF is something to behold and I believe all of us who run, or participate in, beer competitions can really learn from this.

So you look suitably awed and wait for them to share their next gem of wisdom. 'I want you to get more big-name reviewers,' they will say. You mutter something about getting a bigger budget. If they laugh merrily and say no, of course not, you're in trouble. They will continually wonder why you do not bring them the moon on a stick, even though your stick is so small, and the moon so far away. But if they say, 'Absolutely, go get Martin Amis's head on a platter, I don't care what it costs,' you are in for so much fun! You will be talking to people's people all day long. Tony Blair will say no! Julian Barnes will say no! Germaine Greer will say no! David Eggars will say no! Martin Amis will probably not even bother getting back to you. Everyone you want will have better things to do: books to write, companies (or countries) to run. Hours of pleasure, after which you will contact your usual go-to guy or gal and they will do a great job.
The title of Tim Hecker's latest album suggests nostalgia, or maybe regret, and the dates on several of the track titles follow suit, but the music itself is anything but backward-looking or nostalgic. The dates here suggest the passage of time and the continual presence of the past — the album cover is a photo of the first of MIT's annual "piano drop" events, from 1972 — because the album is about degeneration and decay, the loss of quality that happens over time. Hecker simply speeds up the process. Working entirely from a day's worth of church organ recordings, Hecker has subjected his source material to rigorous and violent processes that transform the organ drones into multilayered digital textures, creeping ambient soundscapes, the music trapped in a tug of war between harshness and beauty. Sometimes these electronic drones subside to a whispery bed of static, while at other times the mix is hot and distorted, artifacts of digital compression punching holes in the underlying organ notes. It's intense and hauntingly beautiful, music in which the specters of loss and destruction are constantly present. [buy]
Anyone who can sell the idea of Liberty to a non-believer and create a True Believer will do more for the cause of freedom than any marksmanship instructor or small group leader. In our world where "relativism" makes Tyranny no better or worse than Liberty it is an extreme position to say that there IS a right and wrong, and that there IS a good and an evil, and that it is GOOD to fight against EVIL. It isn't a thousand or a million trained riflemen that make Tyrants fear the night. It is the thought that there are True Believers who oppose, who will not "be reasonable" who will not "talk it out" who will not "compromise" who will not waiver in their faith and course. Faith gives rise to action, it must, or it is not faith.
Go ahead. Give yourself permission to be grateful. Somedays it's harder than others, particularly if the kids are sick, the car won't start, or you've missed an appointment. But I firmly believe being grateful helps us get through the tough days a little easier. I look forward to reviewing these posts a while from now and, with any luck, it will remind me what a full life I have, making any difficult days just a tad better.
I am wearing sandals today because it's a beautiful day and I am eager to take full advantage of it! It was a bit of a process digging under the bed to find the bag with all the summer shoes in but totally worth it. Not just because the ballet flats I wore yesterday (from Topshop) gave my little toe a blister and nothing rubs it when wearing sandals!

Today, this city officially called Godsend, this City of Bones, has become the most holy city in all the realms. It might not be the largest, but it is certainly one of the busiest. We get all sorts here: pilgrims and mercenaries; merchants, artisans; adventurers and tomb-robbers; historians, explorers, archaeologists; rich men and poor. Most end up in either the TEMPLE or MERCHANT QUARTERs; those that live and work here, and can afford it, call the RESIDENTS QUARTER home; we even have a quarter that has been claimed by those with the gold to spare and spend: the NOBLE QUARTER; although it's not just full of nobles– it's also home to the library, the museums and art galleries, and the most expensive restaurants and coffee-houses to be found in the city. Then there's the GREEN HILL– you can see it from here, peeking above the buildings to the West, that fortified, walled hill– that's where the rulers of our city run the place, some even making their homes there. It's also where the council chambers, courts, prison and barracks can be found. The last section of the city, enclosed and walled off from the rest, is where the WEEPING CHASM begins. We'll pay a visit there, when we take a stroll to see the DELVERS' GUILD.

Rod Stewart: I Used To Love Him, But It’s All Over Now
The upshot is that it would take a LOT for me to go flatting again. I would be happy to spend 3/4 of my money on rent and live alone rather than share with other people again. I’m sure I have probably put other people off flatting as well with my strange habits. I wish there was a realistic solution for people like me…perhaps a retirement home for the young?? Some kind of communal housing where you live in a parkland setting with single person units that let you keep cats.
I used to hate it when I had a particular sergeant who used to pull my tickets as favors for friends of his or for people that he wanted to suck up to, and I'll be damned if I'm going to do that to my officers. If they wrote a ticket, that's their call and I wasn't there so I have no business second-guessing them. That's what court is for.

I don’t know how having a child with Down syndrome has changed Kelle, because she doesn’t really ever say. Has she done a HUGE benefit to the Down syndrome community by showing that Down syndrome can be beautiful and that life can be good with Down syndrome? A resounding YES! And I thank her for that. But there’s more to this whole journey than just image – or at least I’d like to think so. People like to say in defense of Kelle that she was all sunshine and rainbows before Nella was born, and she’s still sunshine and rainbows – it’s not like she’s changed, for goodness sake! Yeah, that’s kind of a problem for me. Why isn’t she changed? Maybe she is. But she doesn’t tell us that.

Don't worry. I was going to take a bus to NY. My mother said, she would pick me up and that we would go to the sheriff for an escort, get them out. Then we head back to Tucson on the bus.

Jackson, who can be the most compassionate, awesome, caring, funny, wonderful kid, can also be just plain horrible. And, unfortunately, his behavior has gotten worse over the past several weeks. I don't know if it's the meds he's on or what exactly is going on with him right now, but he got so mad at Clayton on Saturday because Clay didn't want to play a game with him, that Jackson ended up trying to beat the snot out of Clay. Thank God I was right there to intervene and I took all the punches and kicks. Sunday, Jackson destroyed the boys' bunkbeds (My friend, Eric, is on bunkbed rebuilding duty), took a knife and cut up his mattress and decapitated some stuffed animals. This morning, again, Jackson got bent out of shape over nothing and tried to strangle Clay, lifting him off the floor with his hands around his throat. Jackson's back in the hospital inpatient again. This is his third admission in a month.
In my years of working in ministry I’ve seen more criticism to those doing the hard work of ministering from those that weren’t in their shoes than I believe I ever would see working in a “secular” job. Why, people? Just because we share the same faith, doesn’t mean we become experts in every aspect of it, or working in the roles God calls us to. There’s a reason why the Bible talks about the body and each person having their role to play. It’s because we aren’t all called to the same things, we don’t have the same giftings, and we can’t possibly understand every calling out there and what it takes to carry it out. There are reasons why some are called to work in pastoral ministry, and some in hospice care. Some are called to be teachers, and others prophets. Not everyone is equipped to leave their current life behind and go live in another culture like a missionary. There are reasons for this, in the same way that not everyone is a brain when it comes to math and building things, and not everyone can do childcare without dropping from exhaustion. And within those roles, there is still more room for our unique personalities and giftings. No two pastors will pastor the same way, and no two missionaries with work in the field in the same way. Yet, for some reason, within the Church we have no end of criticism and advice for those that minister around us.
Alison Bechdel’s autobiography centres around the family business; a funeral (‘fun’) home, and her childhood and growing up, although really it focuses on her issues with her father, Bruce Bechdel, and coming to terms with being a lesbian. Alison’s father is painted as a remote man, unpredictable, angry, and distant from his children. The reasons for this – that he was a closet homosexual who was having affairs with male students, and Alison’s babysitter – don’t become clear until later on in the book, but they have a considerable effect on Alison herself both consciously and unconsciously. She feels as a child that he loves their big, historic house more than his children, and is more interested in renovating it than in spending time with her and her brothers.
I always knew life was an illusion but it became so real after years of getting it beat into my head. I was told I could do anything, be anything, just as long as I worked hard for it. I do work hard but now I’m finally learning the importance of enjoying life. I cook and listen to music and learn random facts about obscure subjects and take pictures of EVERYTHING.

It wasn’t until after the referendum in 1995 that divorce was finally recognised in Ireland, so it is perhaps not surprising that we still have the lowest divorce rate in the EU with just 0.8 divorces per 1,000 per annum, that’s about 3,500 in total each year. And presumably each of these gives rise to the need for a new dwelling. We’ve always had annulment and separation of course and it might be that these are now seeking divorces instead. The EU average divorce rate is 2.1 per 1,000 andBelgium has the highest rate of 3.0 per 1,000 per year.

Romney’s potential path to the Republican nomination relies on a sizable win in New Hampshire, where he owns a summer home and has been laying the ground work for his run since he withdrew from the 2008 presidential race. Though Iowans will be the first to cast ballots on Jan. 3, Romney spent three days touring New Hampshire last week in his campaign bus – hitting as many as six stops in one day. We'll see how it goes. Romney should be okay with a New Hampshire win, and if Ron Paul takes Iowa we all can prepare for an epic attack campaign launched by the GOP political establishment. After that we could see Newt Gingrich raise a challenge in some key states. But the former House Speaker failed to qualify for the Virginia ballot, where the election is scheduled for March 6, which could cause problems for Gingrich if the campaign drags out to the later months of the season.

Jack finally catches up and we begin to walk through the opening in the wooden fence, and I place my hand on his shoulder. I can feel him shivering as we cross the schoolyard. I tell him, "We need to stop at the nurse's office so you can change your clothes, you're soaked." Jack starts to object, "But I don't..." Interrupting, I say, "Remember, this is why she has the clothes in her office, so if you need to, you can change." We enter the building and head down the long hallway. When we come to the open door of Nurse Linda's office, the first door down on the right, I knock as we walk in.

Due to “Obama’s” destruction of the dollar and insane mandates, many states refuse to accept the authority of any federal branch of government, or any local authority who invokes federal authority, in order to reign them in. These states do not formally declare independence, so they cannot be said to be in a state of rebellion. There are so many points of non-obedience around the country, and “Obama” has so exhausted the treasury and the agencies of armed force at his disposal, that he is impotent to do anything, and the nation disintegrates. Different states and regions then formally declare independence, with some engaging in forced population transfers, while others stick with what they have. (Think the early 1990s in the Soviet Bloc and its aftermath.)

Everyone knows cats are cute and affectionate. Well, maybe the people who don’t have cats think that. Pia and Fluff are my two cats; Pia is lazy and can’t catch a bird if it waited for him. Pia spends his day lounging on Mom’s bed, then with much effort, gets up to get to his food-bowl, it takes more effort to get up the stairs and curl up again. We adopted Pia thinking he would be playful like a little kitten (which at the time he was a half-grown kitten). But we were wrong, he is the opposite.

As a small aside, in the mid-twentieth century Clement Greenberg helped articulate the theory of medium specificity which is all about syntactic art. Greenberg believed that art cannot truthfully relate anything other than an exploration of the medium it has been made with. This caused films such as Andy Warhol’s Empire, 1964, which is an 8 hour recording of the Empire State Building. Time is specific to the medium of film, which makes this a prime example of syntactic art. A prime example of semantic art would be any landscape or still life or portrait – anything that represents reality.
From the hot, sandy beaches to the crumbled, torn-up sidewalks, experiencing SE Asia is a challenge to even the healthiest feet! The concrete in Bangkok goes on forever. But in Malaysia, it’s a miracle to walk down any sidewalk without falling in a hole or tripping on an uneven sidewalk. Penang is simply the worst – I could never look up when walking in Penang – I always had to look at the sidewalk! The holes and loose bricks and uneven walkways were a constant threat! And the feel of icy cold water everywhere during Songkran in Chiang Mai – wow! The winner though, hands down, is the feeling of motion here. The ferries, trains, buses and minivans are not for the faint of heart! Dramamine is my friend!!

Star Bar - One of the best kept secrets in Denver. A few buddies invited me out to this place and knowing that they were professional brewers I thought they were joking. It looked like just another dive bar with Karaoke and Coors Light. Well, they are a total Karaoke bar and they did have Coors Light, but they also had Russian River Sanctification, Avery Collaboration Not Litigation, New Belgium Le Terroir and Ooh La La on tap and an excellent selection of craft cans like Dale's Pale Ale and Modus Hoperandi. Proof that in Colorado, you can find great beer in even the most unlikely locations.

Greece's Dephosphorus on the other hand grabbed me immediately. A welcomed change in production affixed with strained, viral like vocals, textured drums and guitars that jumped from grinding lines to His Hero is Gone style riffs makes Dephosphorus's side far superior. For those of you that heard their previous effort Axiom, be thankful that Dephosphorus has done a better job in producing this split material (that snare drum that stuck out on Axiom is long gone). The only downside of their effort is the lack of time to venture into the spacey cosmo stuff that made Axiom such a gem.
For my first card I inked up a piece of ivory linen card, using 'scattered straw' and 'shabby shutters' distress inks, and 'bamboo' memento ink, then flicked drops of water on it from a paintbrush.

Meanwhile, in a move that will surely give a significant boost to Liverpool’s hopes of regaining their status as the biggest club on Merseyside, Dirk Kuyt looks to be on his merry way to the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. Kuyt has a year left on his contract with Liverpool but the Dutchman is set to be swooned by the bleached-bearded Lothario that is Thorsten Fink, a man who looks like he spends his weekends in front of a wind machine recreating classic Take That videos wearing nothing more than a pair of dungarees and a I-can’t-believe-this-has-ended-like-this-when-we-had-so-much-going-for-us look. “He has class, and he is also a fighter. There is nothing more that needs to be said about the quality of this player,” alleged Fink of Kuyt. More good news for L iverpool fans comes in the form of the imminent signing of Clearasil-skinned striker Luuk de Jong.

Well, we found great tea, coffee and cake in York in the end, but it took us 4 or 5 trips to find it. It’s shocking how a city like York, which has hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, has so many tea rooms, cafés and coffee shops serving up soulless, mediocre food and drink. Perhaps it’s because there is such a massive footfall that they get away with poor quality and service.

I spent yesterday evening with my sister, and it was the first time she'd been to my new apartment. She loves the place, and is so excited for me because it's the first time I am living completely alone. We started to discuss the feeling this experience brings, and both of us were having trouble putting our fingers on it. I saw this as a challenge, and possibly a great blog topic...
Now, if we were for sure going to do a shunt surgery, then I would have grumbled but come back on Wednesday and just stayed. But I just wanted to talk to the guy about our options. There is no way I am making this trip again. Oh, Maria knew I was mad. She told me to call the next day and ask to speak with only her. Um, no way. And at this point Nate was barely holding it together after a long day, and we just had to get out of there. I was just floored by the whole situation. It was one of those times that are so ridiculous that you know God has to be doing something here, ya know? This has never happened before. And I don't know what God has up his sleeves, and honestly I'm a little bit ticked about it! :) But we left. And somehow I got turned around on a back road--which is really odd because I always take the same way out of town and never get lost--and somehow I ended up at the side entrance of the apartment where I lived when I was pregnant with Nate during the MOMS study! What? So somehow I ended up back at the beginning. I still don't get God sometimes.

Since the basement closet was a dismal failure. Trying again one more time. Children were blessed abundantly with clothes while husband's visiting parents were here all last week. As grateful as we are for children's needs being so abundantly met.....entire wardrobes for 11 children have the potential to be very amazingly overwhelming to the head. If anything has the ability to make me crazy....it's clothes. And people think I'm joking when I say I'm a day away from joining a nudist colony. The everybody closet has made life easier in every regard....but we lost it here for a few months. The walk in closet of our last home proved to be amazing for the everybody closet purpose. The basement here....not so much. With only 1500 sq ft to work with within the entire house finding a spot for anything has proved challenging. Clothes have been the reason for tears on more than one occasion....as it proved to be yet again last week....even as minimally as I require wardrobes to be for everyone. Even just 1 pair of shorts, 1 pair of jeans and 3 t-shirts for everyone quickly adds up.....to 56 articles of clothing to be exact. And given the excessive daily use of just 1 pair of shorts and the holes that wore in them in a mere week's matter of time it didn't take a genius to quickly surmise one pair of shorts for each person would never work. But when we have a more reasonable 3 pair per person that's already just 39 pair of jeans alone. That doesn't even begin to include the 2 loads of towels per day, underwear, shirts and everything else. Patient husband had great mercy and compassion on my overwhelmed self and made room within the budget for cheap, plastic sturdy shelving, as the huge commercial metal shelving we put in basement proved to be too huge for the inside of house. It's now serving as a place for water laden boxes that no longer have any strength to be stacked. I moved entertainment center out of office area, as it was only serving as kitchen pantry storage, and put the shelves together to create our new everybody closet. Located in the office right off the kitchen where washer/dryer closet is located, this is proving to be quite amazing. It's easy to keep organized and put away, clothes can be put up even during naps, and when anything is out of order or strung out it's seen quickly and easily picked up....and washer/dryer are right around the corner! I really really love this.

You can share what you have gone through to others, but without judging, though sometimes the truth of your judgmental might needed to be shared and released for the purpose of healing. Even if it happen, we are to ask forgiveness to God and release forgiveness to anyone who might have hurt you as well, but being open to share to someone all that you have gone through and who would listen to you and pray with you.

Every time he returns he fits less into the home that was once his security. He chafes at the changes i make and wonders aloud when i am going to move to a smaller place. He finds it difficult to eat as a family and often reminds me of his childhood with a silly or sweet story. His room is just a storage unit that he sleeps in. He remarks often that he will not be home next summer, he will find a place there. I remark that he is welcome to come home if he wants. He is moving on right before my eyes and it is as it should be. At times i am aware, at times i am not. His independence is my old age, my change of life, and although it is as it should be; it is not always wanted or accepted.

Most of our corals are vintage or farm raised and most shells are beautiful byproducts of the food industry.
The underlying themes of oppression and revolution: This is one area where losing the first person narrative of the novel is an advantage. Director/writer Gary Ross and the writing team (that included Collins) actually go beyond the events of the first novel by cross-cutting scenes of unrest in District 11, backstage elements of the Games emphasizing how the gamemakers think, and interactions between President Snow and Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane. Where the novel, due to the first person narration, is Katniss-centric to the point of not fully developing things that Katniss and readers will have to be caught up on in the second book, the film does an excellent job of preparing viewers for what is to come in the next installments. It also ramps up the stakes of what is happening in the arena and how Katniss’ naive and heroic acts are seen as rebellious.

Saturday, we're having a garage sale. Of course, we don't know how to have a plain old garage sale like regular folk. Instead, ours will be more like a party.

We'll pass on having coffee, because knowing me, in my heightened garage sale state, I will no doubt sell the coffee maker if someone makes me an offer...lol! That would make Kirk very sad (and grumpy). Last time we had a garage sale, we started at 8:00am and sold everything by 9:15am and there was no short supply of stuff.

We ended up sounding nothing like the Ramones, but I figure it was for the best really.

Never give up on what God has already pre-ordained for you. Stand tall, stand strong. Persevere, be patient. Be kind and bless others. Pour into others and others will eventually pour into you.

Before beginning my South American bike tour I asked the same question to experienced rider and inspirational author Andrew Morgan of Teacher on Two Wheels. This was his response:
Look at what you do to fulfill the needs of others as it will likely make a difference in what and how you do what you do and in the way you describe and explain what you do.

So I haven’t been online much since I’ve started to finish my commissions, which I have to finish by this Friday. I’m nearly done, and obviously not my best work because I was rushing so damned much. Anyway, I seem really unfocused and exhausted from not really doing anything strenuous lately… ugh. I hate this feeling.

If human consciousness is to be sustained on planet earth, we need to stop denying our responsibility and accountability for the conditions that we have created around us. It is imperative that we begin to take full responsibility not only for the health of our bodies, hearts and minds, not only for the health of our communities, but as well as, or even more so, the health of the planet we live on.
Well, how am I getting on with my impossible list of stuff to do?

Black Diamond Brewing - This beer is mostly about the yeast and spices used - a White Labs Saison Yeast blend allowed to ferment warm in a base of Pilsner, wheat, aromatic, Munich and Crystal malts, with some turbinado sugar to lighten the mouthfeel. Big aromatic spices hail from cardamom seeds and ginger ground at the brewery along with both bitter and sweet orange peel added in the last 10 minutes of the boil.
So there's my review. I've tried my best to be absolutely honest however as you probably know if you follow either my blog or the Lime Crime drama i really hate this company. The colours are pretty and I would wear every one of them, while they certainly aren't unique some of them are definately hard to find and wouldn't be found in many drugstore brands. However the formula is awful and i personally am not pleased with it at the price we paid, let alone the £14 you will pay for them instore. You can get at least a similar shade to every one of the colours elsewhere if you know where to look and in general you will get a much better formula for a cheaper price.
However, after thinking about it, I came up with a solution that ought to make everybody as happy as rats in a cheese factory. It’s amazing what you can accomplish by simply giving people what they want.
“I Am a Singer” has focused on artists and performers who are not currently enjoying a great amount of mainstream popularity, so our choices must exclude massively popular acts. The singers or bands may have once been popular in the past and we are being a little flexible with what we consider popular. Since this is indie/underground we're talking about, few singers and bands will fail this test.
From what I've seen, "choice" segregates schools. People are just attracted to communities that feel familiar. It is frustrating.

As I made it past the A songs then the B songs I was cruising effortlessly into the C's when there it was. I paused as I rushed past and returned and I smiled inwardly, I should have known. I never pass this song without listening to it.

I went to Archiver's today, to see the Holiday Card Show Case. They had alot of cute ideals, for card making for the Christmas Season. I met two of my friends there Tammy and Mary. We enjoyed the free class and then made two free Christmas Cards also. During the class we made a gift tag and colored a image with Copic Markers and did some dry and wet embossing. With the cards I made last night, I used the same paper pack by We R Memory Keepers and Colored with Copic Markers the images. The digital stamps used was Torico's, Little Muslings, Digital Doodling, and Shelley's Rusty Pickle. I used Martha Stewarts border and snowflake punch. I used Ek Success border punch, gems, ribbon and chip board letters from paper pack, faux eyelets, pearls, flowers and brads. Have a wonderful and blessed weekend and week! Thank you for stopping by my blog!
I trust that STV explore this issue more fully. What is the view of the Cardinal on inter-special marriage?

Thanks for being a blog-lover,
So Saturday came and I was nervous, I was leaving for Paris in 4 days, I had just got some new clothes in to look all chic and what not in France, only problem...I didn't have a strapless bra for this shirt. So my friend Amber put TWO on me since she had bigger boobs and laced me up. I was so nervous I remember my hair wasn't cooperating, I was worried I looked like a tramp and well I really wanted him to like me.

Growing up on a Maryland dairy farm, I noticed a stir in the domestic animals. While living on the edge of a wilderness, deep in the northern forests of Maine, next door to the Province of Quebec, Canada – there was a mystical stir in the icy atmosphere – something too subtle, or too delicate to notice, while indoors, sitting by those flickering flames of the hearth.
Perhaps now, or even long ago, he no longer exists at all, he has departed to an ethereal adventure; but I don’t like to think so, not at all.

When I was a teenager, I worked for a newspaper. I was an assistant copy editor, and I also wrote articles. My editor could always count on me turning in a lot of material. My articles were lengthy. Give me a story about a local fair, and I’ll write you a book. I was proud of that ability. I felt that I could make any news piece long and interesting. I considered it a challenge. Sports column? No problem. I can write sports. 4-H spotlight? I’ve got that, no sweat.
For some reason, we very quickly forget about the “good” experiences and we concentrate on the “bad”. We tell ourselves we do this to PREVENT further “bad” experiences, but in reality, as Hale Dwoskin puts it, we are just carrying on our backs a huge baggage that has nothing of value in it. How silly. This “baggage” turns into a button that from time to time is pushed by outside circumstances/people in our lives, and it causes strong negative feelings. Eckhart Tolle calls it the “pain-body”. It’s that moment that someone in your life does something and you feel hurt because it reminds you of a past experience. That is the “x” that I have been talking about.

To get to the Siecha Lakes entrance you can take public transport from Bogota to a town called Guasca. From this town you will take another bus for 30 minutes (running every hour or so) that will drop you at the end of the road, then it’s a 1 hour 20 minute walk up the dirt/mud track to the entrance of the park. If that’s all a bit too much before taking the 4 hour hike, you could also book a tour with Makuna Ecotravel, an eco tourism company, who will organise transport, reservations and a guide for you. And of course, the third option, if you don’t have your own car, is to make friends with someone who has one, preferably an off-road type that will get you all the way up the muddy track.
If I am able to answer your question, I will do so in the most conscientious manner possible. Be aware that I don’t haggle over non-essential doctrine or anything that might create unnecessary controversy or division in the Body of Christ. We need more unity, and less fragmentation.
The festive atmosphere our hosts had created was impressive. There were streamers, balloons, multi-colored lights and piñatas. The tables were set up with popcorn for an appetizer and as much lemonade as we could drink. Although I wasn’t accustomed to fish that hadn’t been covered in batter and deep-fried, that fish was amazing. Many of my fellow students opted out of the main course because the fish were presented to us whole – head and eyes and all. Yum. After the meal we had a great time with piñatas and just hanging out with the kids.
First thing to get was a large piece of MDF from Lowe's (around $20, they cut it to size for me). We have a King size bed, so the measurements were around 78x35 for ours (I actually could have made it a few inches narrower though)

Despite how much the staff may care about him and want to help, the tests and treatments that he needs are not available to him in Romania, and that is why we began pursuing an international medical visa almost one year ago. It took an entire year to get everything straightened out with both the Romanian and American hospitals, and to help his parents to understand his condition and what is available to him abroad. We thought we had everything figured out, but after two ten hour round-trip visits to Bucharest this week, Raul has been denied a medical visa. The reasons they gave being, 1: they did not believe we would bring him back despite signed legal documents, and 2: the parents do not qualify for visas to the U.S., and somehow that means Raul does not either even though they will not be traveling with him.

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
This Thanksgiving will be bittersweet. This year, three people who are important to members of my family won't be here. The boys will not see their biological father. They have not mentioned anything about it, but it has been on my mind. Even though the two of us have had a tumultuous relationship over the past few years, he was still their father. Mike's father won't be here to play the role of patriarch at the family Thanksgiving, always the consummate host. There will be a huge hole in the celebration. And finally, my sweet Muz is celebrating with Jesus and making sure that the Thanksgiving table in Heaven is set "just so"... But she won't be with us, and I know my mother will be so affected.

Scarlett Johannson has denied that she’s carrying Sean Penn’s baby and I, for one, believe her. The bulge in her belly could have many innocent explanations, such as a bout of dropsy or too many side orders of potato wedges. She might even be hiding a gopher beneath her sweater like a mommy kangaroo. Most actresses go through a sentimental phase about animals. We gorillas will always remember the visit of Daryl Hannah, who approached our hairy community like a girl in search of a piggy-back ride. A kindly female patted her on the head and gave her some roots to chew.

My second wish…is that you all come to my funeral – please do! It really will be an occasion to remember. It was planned when I was thirteen, with two girls who were equally as silly as I was/am…and it is set to be terrrrrific! I’m not entirely sure we’ll be able to get John Hannah to read W H Auden’s ‘Funeral Blues’, nor do I think the organisers of the service will deem it appropriate to play the Tenacious D track we were a bit obsessed with at the time…but I hope those girls remember my other wishes (with the addition of a Love Actually style music surprise as I go up the aisle (Kiera Knightley’s wedding)).

It was a great show with the part of Elle being played by the understudy who (with a blonde wig on) looked just like Reese Witherspoon. Ray Quinn and Les Dennis were the familiar faces but the whole cast were great. It was rather cheesy and some songs weren't as catchy as others, but the main songs made up for it. I have even caught Jonathan singing one of the songs that I haven't been able to get out of my head, and he didn't even go!
Unlike the armed services, the founders, the work we do or the planet, for most Americans the arts, and especially that seemingly esoteric, occasionally controversial art form called “jazz,” just don’t occupy the same ideological real estate. Yet according to most musicians and journalists, jazz is far more popular and respected outside the United States. In other words, International Jazz Day might be most needed on the national scene of the music’s birthplace.
Miranda Priestly: ‘This… stuff’? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select… I don’t know… that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise. It’s not lapis. It’s actually cerulean. And you’re also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent… wasn’t it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff.

“This commitment represents unprecedented leadership by the higher education sector, which is the first and only major U.S. sector with a significant number of its members to commit to climate neutrality.

“Dick Cavett and Johnny Carson don’t know what to say to anybody black, unless there’s some black bitch on the show and she’s all over them,” he told me while conducting a guided tour of his unconventional but comfortable Upper West Side residence. “It’s so awkward for them, because they know all the white facial expressions, but they’re not hip to black expressions, and God knows they’re not hip to Chinese expressions. You see, they’ve seen all the white expressions, like fear, sex, revenge. White actors imitate other white actors when they express emotions, but they don’t know how black people react. Dick Cavett is quiet now when a black cat is talking to him, because he doesn’t know if the expression on his face means ‘I’m going to kick your ass,’ or if ‘right on’ means he’s going to throw a right hand punch. So,” he continued, pointing out the oddly shaped, multi-level blue tile bathtub, “rather than embarrass them and myself, I just play on those shows and tell them not to say anything to me—I have nothing to say to them anyway.”
Last week was spent on more felt business. I had to finish stitching the backing on the large underwater piece and get it ready to hang. I was submitting it to a juried fiber art show in West Hartford. The show is titled 'Out of the Loop' and is put on by the West Hartford Art League. It was stressful for a few reasons; driving down toward Hartford and getting lost for an hour being just two of them. I am happy to be able to say that my work was accepted along with the work of three of my good friends from the Northeast Feltmakers Guild. Go Felters!! I am also still working at getting the four pieces that are going to be in the Wesleyan Potters annual show and sale ready for exhibit. I find that I can not attend to that boring finish work for very long. I also am good at procrastinating at things like that when I think I have plenty of time. I am a bit more motivated since last week though. I added to my own stress because what I thought was plenty of time to finish sewing the backing was not. After I finished sewing I hung the piece and it no longer hung flat. I wound up finishing the sewing at the gallery. How unprofessional is that! Ah Well...live and hopefully learn.

This is not a hard and fast rule, and this tenet is not very popular with music geeks, but in general I think pop musicians have a wider scope of influence than cult musicians. Obviously, there are exceptions to that rule (eg: The Pixies. But who ever thought indie rock would become pop?)
I've always loved animals. Some I like more than others, such as horses and dogs. The others, well. Insects are not my favorite animals, but as long as they don't try to get in bed with me or share any sort of personal space, I'm not terribly bothered by their existence. Slippery and/or legless things can consider themselves included in the latter group.

The heroes engaged in a battle against the Hulk, and soon learned the truth. They then engaged in a titanic struggle against the god of mischief and won. Four issues later Captain America was found floating in the ice in the Arctic Circle. The Sentinel of Liberty was alive and only needed to be revived. He was thawed out and joined the Avengers in battle against Namor. After that battle, Steve, Tony and Thor swore an oath on Mjolnir that if ever any of them were summoned they would respond.

Emmy the Great and Tim Wheeler — “This Is Christmas” (Infectious) Hong Kong-born and London- based Emmy the Great teams up with her boyfriend, Ash vocalist Tim Wheeler, for this collection of energetic and unpretentious — and sometimes very goofy — pop carols.

I am only interested in Waters' celebrity polemics in the reactions it inspires in Pink Floyd fans. Well, not all fans. I'm thinking of specific fans, those young Jewish (mostly male) Zionists who love the Greatful Dead, Phish, Floyd, Marley, and Shlomo Carlebach. I refer to the largely American, Jerusalem-based yeshiva crowd. The first generation of these hippies-turned-frummies successfully recruited a second generation of college-age Jews, the new ortho-chic.

We find tea one of the necessities of life in the strictest sense of the word. A Chinese never drinks cold water, which he abhors and considers unhealthy. Tea is his favourite beverage from morning until night; not what we call tea, mixed with milk and sugar, but the essence of the herb itself drawn out in pure water. One acquainted with the habits of this people can scarcely conceive the idea of the Chinese Empire existing were it deprived of the tea plant; and I am sure that the extensive use of this beverage adds much to the health and comfort of the great body of the people.

Having spent two months in Iran, we are not unduly worried, but even if we were, there is no alternative.

“And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ‘Courage, child, your sins are forgiven.’ At that, some of the scribes said to themselves, ‘This man is blaspheming.’ Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said, ‘Why do you harbor evil thoughts? Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins’ – he then said to the paralytic, ‘Rise, pick up your stretcher, and go home.’ He rose and went home. When the crowds saw this they were struck with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to human beings.”(Matthew 9:2-8, emphasis added)

The removable bottoms are great for keeping the nest boxes clean, and are actually quite durable. Homemade is great and saves money, but if you have ever had to scoop out some of the stuff that accumulates in nests, you know what I am talking about, broken eggs, chicken crap, add a little heat on a hot summer day, and it’s enough to make you urp right there. This type of nest box would be indispensable too, if you get some kind of pest infestation on your chickens. Pests can hide in every nook and cranny. I can pick up that nest box and carry it outside on my hip, remove the bedding, take out the bottoms and give the entire shebang a deep cleaning. That is impossible to do with a fixed wooden nest box scenario. But, a free ranging chicken lives forever, never craps in the nest or breaks an egg and probably is pest free too, so maybe this last paragraph was a sale’s pitch for free-ranging chickens, I don’t know… .

What's really behind the complaints of the commercialization of Christmas has something to do with the psychology of a Judas, I think. Not Judas insofar as he was a betrayer, but insofar as he objected to expensive perfume being used to anoint Christ (John 12:4-6). Judas's pride prevented him from sharing in the mystery of Christ's redemptive act as did Mary. What follows is envy and the will to destroy the good of another. So he objects that the oil could better have been used for the poor. Similarly, some see the joy of Christmas expressed in others and are unable or unwilling to share it themselves. So they must find a reason to poison the fruit, and the method at hand is the condemnation of Christmas as too commercial.

Evening shares its laughter with the trees of Jerusalem
I cheered LB on the whole way, and miraculously, she found MANY more energized moments. She would see people cheering, or a landmark like Paul Brown Stadium, or I'd tell her one more turn and then we'd be headed back the way she came, and all of a sudden she would BOLT. I'd run, too, with my heart probably beating at the top of its range, and then we'd walk again. LB was fascinated that we got to run under the highway bridges. I taught her that you don't have to stop and stay at the water table to drink it, and she seemed to relish being able to throw her cup on the ground. I told her that she needed to go out for track when she was older because she was one awesome sprinter. We stopped to pose for a picture, taken by the GOTR volunteer rounder-upper, who then laughed as LB took off again and I broke into a full sprint to stay with her. She seemed to feel pretty good about passing 2 miles, and soon we could see the Purple People Bridge. Just on the other side of that bridge, I told her. I asked her if she ever thought she'd run 3 miles and she grinned and shook her head. I said even one mile is far. "One mile is ok," she said, "but three is a challenge!"

As might be expected in a British western, the attempt to recreate a western town in a studio leaves a little to be desired.

This is a nightmare, do they snore? Will they hog the bathroom? Will they be tidy? On one production they decided to stick the runners in their own cottage, two girls and three boys all sharing one working shower that was located in the girls room. Hideous. Having boys wondering into your room in the morning to shower and leaving bits of themselves in there. Disgusting. But this was luxury compared to my next accommodation.
I'll have an assorment of goodies to share ... from earrings to Potpourri ... so it should be fun.

Live cricket match in these podcasts. It is not just cricket that you will be completely satisfied through cricket podcasts. So, you can actually be anything. It can take up cricket mania all over world. People hold huge posters and photos of their arched backs. They are black in color, have antennae which is one such sport or rather a fun game that is played in the 1996 cricket world cup dvd and broke the 1996 cricket world cup dvd of devoted fans, they were probably congratulating themselves on the cricket world cup 2003. Field crickets cause much damage to furniture upholstery, draperies etc. since they reside underground and tend to damage the 2011 cricket world cup. Female mole crickets lay an average of 150-400 eggs.

We have visited the park, went to the one in Congleton mainly because our son had an appointment at the hospital there, so we thought we would take them to the park there for an hour before the appointment, then home, they made pizzas with EJ’s daddy before having tea, then it was time for me to pump up the air bed, EJ decided she would sleep on it with Olivia, mainly because it was a double airbed and it can fit them both on, so thats what they did.
As you might imagine, this was a creative process that was a “no brainer” for me to plan. On any given day; I hand-roll, hand-torch and hand-sculpt my own beads and incorporate them into fun and functional jewelry and home decor items. I am creative with the beads I create.
By the way, I saw Nine, which was largely z^3, but man Fergie can sing! And she plays this speechless vagrant who lives on the beach near a Catholic school in Italy where she runs a seaside business corrupting young boys with her fishy fishnets for a few coins a pop. But still, I wouldn’t suggest dropping your 10-12 Chavito$ on that movie, it’s like Hollywood for Dummies. Go see Fergie live or write some YouTube comments.

6. Stop judging others: “The monk, says Moses, must never judge his neighbor at all in any way whatever.” “They said of Abba Macarius that just as God protects the world, so Abba Macarius would cover the faults he saw, as though he did not see them, and those he heard, as though he did not hear them.”

It’s obvious King Philip bought me for my beauty. When the sun shines, my coat glows gold and my mane gleams pale as ripe flax. When the grooms comb it out properly, my tail ripples like a banner AND I can carry it just as high as any silly Persian gelding! I should have been Prince Alexander’s royal horse. We should all have stayed at home in Pella and taken part in parades, where everyone would have thrown rose petals over us and cheered, without us having to fight any bloody battles in the wilds of Asia.
Sprinkle your spices right on top of the coffee grounds when preparing to brew. You don’t even need to mix! Other spices you could use could include all spice, pumpkin pie seasoning (or any kind of pie seasoning really), nutmeg, ground vanilla, or ground cocoa. Go nuts and get creative! The flavor is so much better when it’s brewed with the grounds as opposed to just adding it to the cup after.

I’m a writer. I’ve always been a writer and have the degrees (and accompanying student loan debt) to prove it. Since I was young, I’ve loved stories. I’d read anything. One teacher called me an omnivorous reader. As a child, my mother would yell at me to stop reading the back of the cereal box (”It hasn’t changed since yesterday!”) or I’d be late to school . And she knew that with a good book, she could keep me busy and placated for hours.

Last summer, we successfully installed a rock wall, did all of our trenching and sprinkler installation, laid sod, poured the rest of our driveway and RV pad, had curbing laid, planted trees, shrubs, flowers, etc. etc etc. We made huge progress last summer, but there were lots of finishing touches that still needed to be made. Also, several of our trees and shrubs died this winter, so we had to replace almost all of them. I can happily now say that we transformed the front yard from this:

I go with the jingoism. Apollo’s death made the fight personal for Rocky, but his demise was still merely the catalyst for an East v. West conflict. I will grant you the boxing match is the most exciting of all the ones featured so far. I have a tough time believing Rocky could win, but there you go. The speech at the end in which Rocky personally brings on perestroika is as hokey as it gets. Then again, the Soviet Union fell six years later, so what do I know?

Because if everything is ultimately material, all causal efficacy must come from matter. So consciousness is recognized, spirituality is recognized, but only as causal epiphenomena, or secondary phenomena. And an epiphenomenal consciousness is not very good. I mean, it’s not doing anything. So, although these books acknowledge our spirituality, the spirituality is ultimately coming from some sort of material interaction.

Last week I went to visit my boyfriend to a country beginning with ‘It’. Don’t ask me how I have a boyfriend, I don’t really know. If it were not for him having pestered me for weeks, I would still be alone! I was too scared to start a relationship with him. What if I didn’t kiss properly and he laughed at me and then left me? What if I didn’t smell nice? What if he just hated me and was saying it as a joke just to be mean? (Yes, these are the real things that go through my head at moments like these). So, anyway, we were in this country and he told me we must dine with his granddad. This is already quite tricky for me since I never know what to talk about with him (or anyone, for that matter). The good thing is, I am able to use the language boundary as an excuse. Actually, I understand everything he says, but I haven’t learnt to speak their language yet for two main reasons:
After dinner, the pussycats go out to play in the big messy backyard, enclosed by cat proof fence. They roll around in the grass having little pretend-fights, and creep up on each other, and pounce, and lurk. And stalk magpies.

Ok, enough comparisons to the book (for now, I’ve still got one more big one for later), let’s just talk about the movie on its own for a minute.
This is the first in a highly unusual crime series featuring Bryant and May of the Peculiar Crimes Unit. Reviews for this series feature adjectives like "offbeat", "quirky" and "eccentric", so I'm betting this will be fun!

Anyway enough about work, can you believe it's only 31 days until Christmas? I have finally given in & made a start on my Christmas shopping at the weekend. To say thank you for the blog support I've had over the last year, I bought an extra gift which I'm giving away this week. Click here for details. The other thing I need to start planning is how I'm going to decorate the Christmas cake. I think it's ready, there's enough brandy in it, I realised the other day it's been fed the best part of half a bottle! I did say it usually comes with an ABV rating.

My good friend, Danielle, made me a whole plate full of brownies, which I devoured (not all of them, of course) and had to pay for it later when poor little Gavin got it all in his breast milk.. Did not sleep a wink that night. I felt so bad for my roommate, that I dragged the bassinet into the bathroom to try to cover up the noise! Ugh! I was so young back then! I should have sent him back to the nursery, but I wanted my baby with me so badly, I would not even consider it. In hindsight, some sleep would have been beneficial. Ah…20/20 hindsight.
I remember most of the ride home, and getting home and going to bed.

It’s my first prompt-response in ages. Here’s my response to Sonia Medeiros’s April-May Writing Challenge. Let me be honest: I didn’t think I’d be able to do it, but there you go. Totally off the top of my head, obviously. I combed through it a couple times, though.
Please don't think lesser of me, but (gasp!) so am I. There must be something wrong with me. Maybe a twisted kink in my DNA helix has stunted my maturation process. That would explain it. Why else would a woman my age still think flatulence is so darned funny?

Very crisp; the bitterness of the quinine really made itself known in this cocktail. There was also a touch of Violette towards the end. It’s rare that I think of colours when tasting drinks, but this one reminded me of purple and black. It was an intense Martini with an intriguing contrast between sweet floral and earthy bitter flavours.

Today I have a card that uses the Rosy Posey set from Taylored Expressions along with the Rosy Posey Dies. I am currently taking the A Cut Above Class at Online Card Classes and I created this card using one of the diecutting techniques featured in the class. . .created a die cut window on your card. I created the window using the Jumbo Heart Border Die. I cut the window across the bottom portion of the card and used acetate for the "window". The patterned papers are from the Fabulous Collection from Simple Stories and are in the April Key Ingredients Subscription from Taylored Expressions. I also die cut the patterned papers so that they would mat the window. I adhered a pink strip of patterned paper on the inside of the card so that it would show through the window. I decorated that strip with hearts that were cut from the die cut strip.

After being discharged seven months later, Ms Parma was informed that, as she was now a wheelchair user, she would not be able to return to her first floor flat.
He also picked up one of the books that we own this week, from Black Lagoon Adventures for a re-read. These are the early chapter books based on the popular picture book by Mike Thaler that he found at Half-Price Books sometime last year. At that point, he was a good reader, but not crazy about it, so you'd better believe that I was willing to spend $2 on as many of those as he wanted to buy since he'd actually read them.

When Mr October, a sexy calendar pin-up vamp, is accused of murdering his girlfriend, an old debt is called in and Genny is forced to help prove his innocence, risking her job and the protection it offers – and threatening to expose her own dark secrets. Searching for the killer plunges Genny deep into the hidden heart of vampire society. It’s not long before she realises that she and Mr October are both unwitting pawns in a centuries-old power struggle between London’s non-human communities . . . and it’s not just her own neck that’s at stake, but the lives of all London’s supernaturals.
It’s a rock and a hard place.

From the opening sequence and from some statements Ibáñez Serrador has made, it's obvious that part of his intention is to make us realize how hypocritical we adults can be about the killing of children -- most people believe it is absolutely wrong to kill children, but in war children are "collateral damage" and even in peacetime millions of children die from easily-preventable illnesses, so obviously we don't really believe it's unforgiveable to kill them. In Who Can Kill a Child, the childrens' behavior is never definitively explained, but there's some talk of evolution and adaptation, and in an interview on the DVD, Ibáñez Serrador seems to indicate that, for him, the explanation is that the children have realized (subconsciously, maybe even genetically) that the biggest threats to their existence are adults, and so they are wiping out the threat. From the opening sequence, Ibáñez Serrador seems to want us to understand that it is in some way or another understandable that children should want to kill adults, since adults kill them so wantonly.
OMG, people love a pregnant woman. I love the attention. I love people asking me about it, when I'm due, if it's a boy or a girl, if we have names, if they can feel it, holding doors, letting me skip ahead in line, making me rest. I love them rubbing my belly and talking to her like she can hear and the pure excitement that everyone seems to exude when around an expectant mother. I know that will all go away once the baby is born and instead of worshipping me and my baby-making vessel they'll just be wishing that the crying baby would shut the hell up. People are all Republicans when it comes to babies...they care about it when it's baking, but once it's outside you're on your own.

Now imagine that the kids in the kinder class took the same attitude. “I’m pretty happy reading picture books, playing in the sand pit and not washing my hands a lot; might just stick at this level”. Luckily for them (and for us) they possess a natural curiousity for the big wide world around them. This thirst for knowledge means that they read increasingly difficult books with bigger and bigger words and they learn to write their names more legibly. They make the leap to the third rung of the monkey bars and they keep getting scraped knees until they can ride a bike or a scooter.

Furthermore, the bill makes it clear that illegal immigrants will not have access to taxpayer benefits such as food stamps and health care through MO HealthNet. With the passage of this legislation, Missouri sent a clear message that illegal immigrants are not welcome in our state, and that they are certainly not welcome to receive public benefits at the cost of Missouri taxpayers.
The General Project Plan, approved in December 2006 by the ESDC, stated (right) that Phase 1 of the project was "anticipated to be completed by 2010" and Phase II was "anticipated to be completed by 2016." However, nine months later, in September 2007, the ESDC signed a funding agreement that gives developer Forest City Ratner much more time and also posits a scenario in which much less housing and open space would be built.

Greene makes even more sense with even a cursory look at the Gallup poll released a week before the June 8 primaries. It found that sixty percent of voters, and nearly 70 percent of self-described independents, said they would rather vote for a candidate who has never before served in Congress. Greene then is the perfect field of dreams for countless numbers of voters. He’s the anti-candidate candidate who got on the ballot with nothing more than moxey, conviction and a vague desire to make change. Then without spending a king’s ransom on the race, without the backing of an armada of telecoms companies, banks, lawyers, unions, tobacco companies and other special interests greasing their campaign wheels, and without cutting endless back room deals can actually win. The first and often the only question anyone who wants to run for office is asked is not what are your ideas and program but how much money can and did you raise? Greene is the candidate who can honestly answer not a penny. The money first and last question drives the polluted stream of American politics.
But it was not just fascinating facts that Sue Armstrong extracted in these interviews, but moral and political aspects of their work too. Derrick Pounder and Sue Black, for instance, described how they coped with dealing with the aftermath of Sarajevo and Kosovo; while there were equally moving revelations from Helen Wainwright and Patricia Klepp about working in South Africa. The interviewer also encouraged the doctors to talk about how they dealt with issues such as race - for instance Kumarasen Cooper described finding himself as the first professor 'of colour' leading a team of white consultants. Another issue frequently addressed is motherhood, andin this context Waney Squier's interview is particularly impressive, since she described with great honesty her part in the 'shaken baby' diagnosis, and the effect of a wrong diagnosis on the family concerned and the doctor herself.

I had been placed on a team with a member of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps and the Light Cavalry HAC. Our other team mate found us and then the rider's briefing began. We were informed that the horses we were about to compete on are the property of Her Majesty The Queen and that any level of poor horsemanship will absolutely not be tolerated. That included excessive use of crop or spurs (if you were riding with either), kicking/pulling, dangerous riding, and unknowledgeable riding (basically if they could see you were obviously in over your head). They also said to always keep in mind if something happens it is YOUR FAULT, NOT your horse's! I thought that was great too! Then they told us that these horses are normally worked at a full gallop and pull gun carriages in 6 horse teams. Love it!!

I know a lot of people seek treatment and there's nothing wrong with that. If it's affecting a person's self esteem, treatment should be considered. I think this is probably especially true with people who have darker complexions where the loss of pigment is more obvious. But it doesn't really bother Jackson at this point. In fact, he thinks it pretty cool that he "glows in the dark"! (The white patches fluoresce under black light.) Right now, the only thing I'm doing is talking to him about the fact that it doesn't matter what a person looks like on the outside. I tell him he's a funny, quick-witted, compassionate, smart kid and that's what counts.
Today i was thinking about that feeling you get when you are so psyched about something and you can hardly wait for it and it's the only thing you can think about. And you get so caught up in your illusions of what it's gonna be that the truth only ends up disappointing.

I debated the merits of this concept with a friend who, although initially keen, expressed some reservations. “Granted, had he longer hair and a harem of drug-addled hippies in tow, I might have more readily grasped his fascination with Charles Manson,” offered my cohort of her recent ex, “ but I really don’t think California drifter circa 1962 is a look applauded by mainstream employers.”
What might be surprising, though, are the places, the groups, and even the individuals who provide support for facilitated communication even though most of them would, if they recognized what was going on, have to deal with the fact that a debunked modality is being used in which the communication of the individual is clearly being co-opted. I say clearly, but perhaps it's only clear when you know what to look for and are willing to look for it.

In Harlequin, a ballet dancer in full costume stands upon a stage, his downcast gaze communicating his isolation. The flatness of the dancer’s costume, emphasized by its geometric pattern, contrasts with the weight and volume of his hands, and its monotone background conflicts with the depth achieved by the curtain. Thus, this rare painting stands as a unique amalgamation between the subject matter of the blue and rose periods and the play with perspective and illusionism found in his cubist works.
Why get a tattoo? That has always been the question, ain’t it? Simply put, I want to get something symbolic of the person I am now that I’m nearing my mid-twenties, to suspend a small piece of my youth in time. Problem is, I still haven’t figured out what that symbol is going to be.
Here is an embarassing story about myself. Not more than a few hours after my parents dropped me off at uni for the first time, I made a complete tit of myself because my male ego failed to stop me from making stupid decisions. I am still trying my hardest to forget that night.
Porters came to be in 1722 (or'30--sources vary) when London brewer Ralph Harwood introduced a mixture of three beers common at the time. He called the resulting brew "entire" or "entire butt" (butt being an olden days word for "barrel"). Porters from the nearby produce market are purported to have liked it, hence the name. (Jackson disputes this.) As for names, I wonder if Deschutes' decision to name their porter after Central Oregon's Black Butte wasn't a nod to Harwood's "entire butt." Someday I'll ask someone.

over the next hour, I dilated from 4 cm to 10 cm. The pain spiked so quickly that I went into a full panic. I couldn't move during the contractions, and all of my coping techniques up to that point simply didn't cut the mustard. I was screaming and punching the bed through each one. If I could have moved, I'd have run away. My spouse was terrified that I was going to hurt myself and kept trying to comfort me in any way zie could. There honestly wasn't much comfort to be had. the pain had me in complete instinct mode. Anything vaguely resembling self-consciousness was gone. My birth coach was livid that I was left to scream that way, and was getting ready to find someone to come and care for me when the nurse and the midwife came in.

This morning I woke up, and looked around my bedroom and realized there are papers, books, magazines, and reciepts from clothes everywhere. I have been meaning to get around to cleaning the papers and what not up, but I've just been avoiding it...until today when I looked outside and saw the rain coming down! Gotta love Canada!

A little later two other friends came to visit, we were on our way to NICU to see the baby. The elevator doors opened and who steps out - my husband! My friends graciously bowed out, allowing my husband to go in and meet Tomas in a private moment. We went in and looked him over. Tomas was not a magazine cover newborn, and it had nothing to do with DS. Oh, he was cute all right, but just had a few quirky things going on. For starters, he had no eyebrows - not a hair in sight. Then his cranial plates were overlapping. When I first saw this I thought it was a DS thing, but the nurses assured me it was a baby thing, and that they would move and shift and eventually fall into place. At the time my husband came in they were overlapping right over the center part of his head and he looked like a little Klingon baby, only with no eyebrows! I could tell he was nervous that this was all permanent stuff so I did my best to reassure him. He didn't want to hold him as there were too many wires and he was too afraid. We just sat there for a long time and watched, and eventually headed up to my room.
Factors behind it could include conflicts over land, power, security and expressions of group identity such as language, religion and culture; patterns of discrimination, overt justification for discriminatory practices; a history of genocide or human rights violations against a particular group; denial by the perpetrators; references to past human rights violations committed against a possible perpetrator group as justification.

The first thing you notice is that the star potential is taken off the table as there is no men’s 100 in either meet. Given that a) the 200 is the lesser contested of the two sprints (100/200) in any season, let alone an Olympic one, and b) with Trials meets coming up it will be less likely to see a sprinter here than in the 100, it’s a fairly safe bet that seeing Bolt, Gay, Dix, Blake, et al is nearly slim to none in the U.S. No offense to any of the other star level athletes out there, but there goes a large chunk of the star quality and drawing power in this sport – no offense just fact at this point – because right now the 100 is The marquee event in the sport.
'Tis so, I deem. The answer's clear!
In my previous post about the Thames Path, I gave the impression that we had now filled in all the bits that we had not walked between Henley and Windsor. This was not strictly true, as there is a small stretch at Cookham that we'd never walked. The reason is probably that the path doesn't actually follow the Thames at this point, but deviates around some private land and through the village of Cookham. Cookham is well known as being the home of the artist Sir Stanley Spencer. There is a gallery there displaying many of his works, amongst which Cookham features prominantly. The gallery is celebrating it's 50th anniversary this year.

The first thing I noticed in the film was that many of the early converts to Christianity were slaves and peasants. They despised higher learning and had no problem condemning all who thought differently from them. It reminded me of the modern tendency for conversion among the lower socio-economic classes. I noticed it as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many of the people who would study and convert were typically people whose lifestyle wasn’t ideal. In fact the JW’s would call the preaching work a search for those “who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things” (Ezekial 9:4). Who but the uneducated and impoverished would look for answers outside themselves and cheerfully anticipate the demise of everyone “better-off”?

When I was in grad school, I had to read Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go for a Contemporary British Fiction course. Talk about a trip! I was familiar with his other novel, Remains of the Day, with its quiet reserve and social conversation. That was what I expected with this newest novel, but that is not quite the direction it headed in.
and when you reach this point
George Wickham is an old childhood friend of hero Fitzwilliam Darcy and the son of the Darcy family’s steward, whose dissipate ways estranged the pair. He is introduced into the story as a handsome and superficially charming commissioned militia officer in Meryton, who quickly charms and befriends the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, after learning of her dislike of Darcy. Wickham manages to charm the entire Meryton neighborhood, before they realize that they have a snake in their midst. Elizabeth eventually learns of Wickham’s attempt to elope with the young Georgiana Darcy. Unfortunately, he manages to do the same with her younger sister, Lydia, endangering the Bennet family’s reputation. He could have been the best of Austen’s rogues, if it were not for his stupid decision to elope with Lydia, a young woman whose family would be unable to provide him with a well-endowed dowry. Because I certainly cannot see him choosing him as a traveling bed mate, while he evade creditors. Here are the actors that portrayed George Wickham:

Heads up: Margaret McSweeney deserves a medal, or at least a commendation for giving everyone a much deserved Mother’s Day rest. Okay, y’all can be seated. I’m glad you agree, but you’re supposed to be taking a load off, remember? Oh, and full disclosure—Margaret didn’t know I was going to say that so I hope she leaves it in, and no, I didn’t do it just because I’m ridiculously nostalgic about the theme of her community, although I am. As the Belle of All Things Southern, one who is southern to the bone, I have a thing about pearls.

What was not as heavily promoted is the fact that for the most part, service on these routes is already supposed to be operating at or around 15-minutes between buses. As detailed by the chart below, there are some peak and non-peak hours that will see wait time reductions on these routes, but are these small decreases in wait times on these four routes worthy of praise amongst all the increases in wait times on most of the other routes around the city?
And it hit me: not only are they horrible people, they're boring!
We're still hurting, a well of grief and anger. I am so tired of all this bad luck. There's a limit even for me.
I don’t often read children’s books, not having any children myself, but I really enjoyed this one! My only complaint is that it simply isn’t long enough. I would like to see Grant write a whole series of them – kind of like the Nancy Drew books I read when I was a kid.
Just as we may find things about ourselves in self-reflection, self-examination, and self-observation that are upsetting, unexpected, or even negative, so too is it very likely that we will find things about beings external to ourselves–whether those beings are humans or deities–that are challenging, difficult, trying, exasperating, and even wholly objectionable. However, coming into contact with such difficulties is not a bad thing in itself; indeed, such challenges are the only thing that allows us to grow and change. We do have control over how we grow and change as a result of coming into contact with those difficulties–we can choose to move toward a greater integration, towards productivity and positivity, towards compassion and forgiveness, understanding and love for those things that are different or even abhorrent, or we can choose to move toward disintegration, negativity, and resentment towards those things which are different, and to forego any attempts at understanding or empathy with them. (I think you can guess which one I’d personally advocate as the better choice in almost every case!) It’s one of the dangers and splendors of dealing with other people, whether those people are humans or deities. I think of it in terms of chemistry, really. Water can sit and contemplate itself all the livelong day, but at the end of the day, it will still be water, with a bit of hydroxide (HO-) and a bit of hydronium (H3O+) mixed in there with the good old H2O for good measure. But, it only can really change when it comes into contact with external agents, and those chemical shifts and chemical reactions only occur when those types of contacts exist; whether the water simply changes color, or whether it becomes acidic, varies from situation to situation–even the most caustic acids have their uses when certain substances need to be dissolved! Likewise with us and the “spiritual reactions” that occur to foster our own development.
If you dig into the data, it does indeed show that, on average, stay-at-home moms are more likely to be young, foreign-born and less-educated than moms as a whole. But that’s hardly a stake in the heart of the idea that you’re seeing a lot of women with college degrees stepping out of the workforce. In fact, though college-educated moms are slightly less likely to be at-home moms, a whopping 1.8 million of the 5.6 million at-home moms have a college diploma. That’s hardly a “small population.”
At the point I got to last night, Rebecca bends over needlessly low to give Chuck (and the camera) a long look at her shapely ass as she unlocks a door. "What are you waiting for?" she asks, beckoning Chuck through. To which, our grieving widower, worried father, and potential fugitive from justice, replies, "Just admiring the view."
Most important of all: would you like posts like this in the future? Granted, it's not going to be swatches of the newest collections - first of all, I can't compete (nor do I want) with all the amazing lacquerheads out there showing us the newest trends, I don't get my hands on them until they've been out for a while anyway, LOL!, and second of all, I don't buy complete collections unless they all appeal to me (which is rare with collections consisting of 6 or more). It would be random untrieds from my stash instead, some still available, some not. Let me know in the comments! :)

One of the keynote speakers last year was Temple Grandin and one of this year's is her mom, Eustacia Cutler. If you are within a day's drive of Northern Virginia and the conference appeals to you, this is something worth attending! (From what I have heard, attendees come from all over the county. Washington D.C. isn't too far away, so some people attach a trip there onto attending the conference.)
Are you familiar with bibliomancy? Bibliomancy is the use of books in divination. The concept is that literature contains “truths” and speak to matters of great importance. Anyone who knows me knows I love to divine all sorts of shit.
CD: Do you have other employment? What is it?
The state-run channel says it aims to bring viewers “another story”, one not told by the so-called mainstream media. In practice, this means bringing viewers the Russian state’s point of view. Let’s not forget how several years ago, Vladimir Putin, who is due to be inaugurated next week for a third presidential term, once “jokingly” praised former Israeli president Moshe Katsav for being a “strong man” because he “raped 10 women” (Katsav is now serving seven years in prison after being convicted of two counts of rape). “I never would have expected it of him,” Putin was reportedly caught saying off-mic during a meeting with then Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert when the allegations first came to light in 2006. “He has surprised us all,” Putin said. “We envy him!”
Referees who throw matches make strategic decisions to award decisions against the team they want to win. So they send off a player in the last few minutes when the impact will be small or give free-kicks in less advantageous positions for the opposition than the decisions they give their favoured team just so the stats look fair.
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.
The ultimate goal now is 75 kgs by April first week. I know its sounds too ambitious, but for me i know how it works, so lets see if i can.
With one Lace-weight project done and dusted I’m quickly moving on to the next: Summer Affair by Carol Feller from her eBook Wearable Lace. I’m using Malabrigo Yarn Lace in Emerald Blue, which (supposedly) has 430m in a 50g skein. I cast-on last Monday and my cake currently weighs 39g, which means I have knit 95m in the past week.
I would like to thank the king for his supportive words, but to be completely honest; I've got no idea at all what he was on about! But I don't give a shit, sometimes all you've got is friends and their words. There's thought, concern and care in there, I know that....and these days....that's enough.
"How ironic. Mine is Cheetos."
Next up I got to get into some OLD School Gaming with an old friend of mine who came into town for the Con and one of the players was an old buddy I used to game with but haven't been able to in a long time, due to work and such.
64 min: Play has yet to resume at Stamford Bridge, wheer Tioté is still being looked after by paramedics. He’s unlikely to continue. Meanwhile at the Reebok, the second half has just resumed and Bolton are applying early pressure on Spurs as they desperately seek an equaliser. “On the subject of artistics movements, don’t forget Merda d’artista by the Italian artist Piero Manzoni, who pooped in a can,” recommends Richard Hooker. “The contemporary footballing analogy would be Merda D’alglish.”
All along, as Bank Street Brewhouse and NABC’s new production brewing operation took conceptual inspiration from “new” ideas, we maintained a conservative approach at the Pizzeria & Public House. We changed absolutely nothing about the tried and true, pizza-based food menu (not the precise point of the current discussion, although to be considered at some point later), and the beer program proceeded largely as before, with a handful of changes. Additional draft lines were freed to provide spouts for the wider selection of NABC’s own beers made possible by our increase in brewing capacity.
Everything you need is still right there inside of you. You haven’t lost it. It is NOT too late. Plug in to the main source. Open up and check around inside. Do you need to purge some social circles? Choose fruit over cake? Devote time to your craft instead of television or social sites? Forgive? What is the issue inside of you that is hindering the progress outside of you?
Conversation with spirits (saying they need human blood to suck!) and frightening dream visitations by spirits are part of occult communication. Meyer’s spiritual experiences could well be influenced by her Mormon faith which allows for communication with the so-called "the dead"; indeed "the dead" of former generations are baptized into Mormonism in Mormon Temple ritual. Mormon founder Joseph Smith was "visited" by a communicating "angel" called Moroni, whose statue stands atop all Mormon Temples. This fallen angel of Mormonism gave Smith messages on which he formed his Mormon doctrine about prior civilizations, none of which have been discovered despite endless archeological digs to substantiate Mormons claims. Others Mormon teachings conflict with biblical Christianity such as Mormonism's claim that Jesus of the Bible is the half-brother of Satan.
Where is he going? I don’t know. I would love to say that I don’t care, that I refuse to feel guilty over this, but- well, he keeps mentioning his damned car. Now, Sis says it could be a gambit to make me feel worse, relent and sneak him back in. Becuase could I really let him live in his car?
Manchester City know the importance of time. Their late strikes on Sunday brought their total of stoppage‑time goals for the season to 10. Arsenal were next best with six. In keeping with a season in which their last few matches were a pointless formality, Wolverhampton Wanderers scored no goals in time added on" Guardian
At the end of the show, the organizers mysteriously brought two planks of wood on stage and set them down on the floor. The two guitarists were busy doing that outro thing where they play the same note over and over, as the drummer crashed the cymbals slower and slower, signifying the death knell.
Its 50, yes, you hear me correct. Big Five Zero. 50.. grrrrrrrrrrrr
Paranoia about Muslim fundamentalist movements and terrorism is causing Washington to make bad choices that will ultimately harm American interests and standing abroad.

Admiral Bruce Clingan; Admiral Samuel Locklear III, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, and Commander, Allied Joint Forces Command Naples; Admiral James Stavridis, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Commander, U.S. European Command; Admiral Jonathan Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations; and U.S. Army General Carter Ham, Commander, U.S. Africa Command at the February 24 command ceremony in Naples at which Clingan replaced Locklear as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa and Commander, Allied Joint Forces Command.
Let's go back to the top of the closet, so you can see that there are two full-length-of-the-closet shelves, perfect for storage of extra blankets, sheets (in bin), clothes that are too small and waiting for their next home (in bin), etc. There's plenty of empty space on the top shelf next to the blankets.... thrilling! That means there is room for growth, if needed. My guess is adding a third child, who will be a girl, will take care of that little problem. ;)
Thanks to his showcase, Jinguk is getting signed to a record label and leaving Kirin High. Hyemi stands outside at night, crying over Jinguk as he leaves and wearing his spare motorcycle helmet which he left for her. She tries to tell Samdong why she's crying, but Samdong breaks down and yells for her not to tell him. Then he makes up his own reason: she's crying over Jinguk because he's debuting before Hyemi, and she's jealous of this success, right? Samdong's basically begging her not to tell him that she cares for the other guy. Hyemi obliges him, and doesn't tell him the real reason.
Like BO, Manson promised “hope” and “change,” and like BO, he demanded unswerving loyalty and mindless devotion from his minions. We’ve seen the seeds of BO’s “helter skelter” labors in the unbelievably unethical and truly slanderous NBC “editing error” of the Zimmerman 911 tapes, in the race-baiting lunacy of the organized leftists’ race complex, in the New Black Panthers’ bounty on Zimmerman‘s head, in the comments of the president as he inserted himself (yet again) into a local issue that had nothing to do with the presidency, and in countless other leftist attempts to create from thin air a powder keg of racial unrest and violence.
St. Paul, a man who I think was tormented by this same question of the limits of realism in different conceptual language (“the law” v. faith), and who sometimes unfortunately came down on the wrong side of the answer, as when he advised women to cover their heads and keep quiet, was in touch with his better self in Philippians 4. He made restitution with me, at least, with this advice that helped me reconcile the research about positive thinking with realism at long last, as the Bible fell open to this passage: “…whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things….”
That's why when you get to Turkatron, you're hearing for The Hussy what is the equivalent of a 4track cassette demo for crying out loud. It's got all the attention to detail of the bigger tracks, but the physical whallop is more restrained, and it's what makes b-sides throughout history so god damn important. Here's an early incarnation of this massive sound, but how they get from there to "Undefined" is anyone's guess. Heather gets familiar with the reverb back off in the distance under a little thinner drum track and takes the reins on this brief number.
He had a reason to write, so he wrote. A duh moment for me.

IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO STAND AGAINST THE CABAL
Today's post was influenced by the month of April. April is autism awareness month, and as I'm sure many of you do, I have friends with children who are autistic. So this is just a little bit of a reminder to look for the signs early on, and get help! If you're interested in reading a bit more, read this site :)
For many Bond fans, this film is the best of the bunch. Holmes and I rate it at a .357 Magnum*. The only reason we exclude it from our top .44 Magnum rating is because it lacks any “life changing qualities.” Your life won’t be changed by this film, but you’ll probably enjoy it.

The canvases in Mark Moore range from one epic panel, to a squarish enigmatic sliver of color either on or under a overcoating of black, to a large grouping of smaller works that use the grid format of the wall to create even further interactions. The many drawings that accompany the show are a nice view into Bavingtons working method.

“Sure, sure,” he answered with a wave of his hand. He had found a rolling pin under the kitchen counter and was staring at it like he’d never seen one before. Momentarily, Moody thought about ordering pizza and having it delivered.

It is noted that there is demand for residential investment property, specifically apartment blocks and reference is made to a number of transactions understood to have recently completed.

I believe that each day we have the opportunity to make changes within ourselves. Not only before marriage, but after. When I am sad, I know that I have friends who share my sadness, but also want me to feel happy. They are there for me and I appreciate all of them. When I change who I am, I try to be better.
Know you are talented. God has great things in store for you!
The doors slide open and I push my trolley out into the pickup area. I can see through the glass doors to the smog-filtered sunlight beyond. The sunlight never quite looks that way anywhere else in the world. I love it. Before long I'm zipping along the freeway with whatever friend has collected me, the wheels whistling on the ruts in a way that never seems the same anywhere else. The palm trees, the freeway signs, the too-many cars in the too-many lanes....it's all here. It's always been here. I always imagine that it's glad I'm back. My LA.
The air was crisp, the color of the Autumn leaves at their peak - the sun was shining brightly.

My sister, Maddy, and I got together last week and decided to do some science experiments. Actually, it was just an excuse to visit. We spent five days goofing off. We made cold porcelain clay, but I don't know yet if I want to sculpt anything with it. Maybe small things, like toys for my Santas, or something like that. It goes by many names: Porcelaina Fria and Biscuit, to name two. If you are not familiar with it, it's the stuff that many artists use to make realistic, life-size and miniature flowers.

I have the lovely Cheery Lynn Butterflies and matching Angel Wings for sale plus some angel wings for previously released dies. In the first video you see some samples I created plus some helpful tips. In the second video I show the dimensional technique by Cheery Lynn plus I gave a few tips that I found helpful. I am a bit scattered in these videos and I apologize. I think I get my point across. I did forget to throw out a thank you to my friend SallyAnn who has helped me discover a love for butterflies-she also gave me a great tip-the little ones can cover up mistakes beautifully..lol..

Then you can start giving the fabric a twist to make the "petals." Try to rotate the twists as you go around the rose so they are not always in the same spots and the "petals" are off centered. I added a dot of glue to the outside edge each time I made a twist...

By the time Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein she had eloped with a poet, lived in France, been estranged from her father, had a baby girl and lost her, become wealthy, accompanied Byron to Geneva, and had a second child, and lost her sister to suicide. The story unfolds with the constant undercurrent of her mother’s suicide attempt, and then her mother’s death in childbirth.
Afterwards, I took a nice long nap, to get ready for my 'bash'. The Hubs and the kids took me to the restaurant. Sadly, I don't have any photos from this event because even though I brought my camera, I was too busy being "in the moment" to take any. Friends did take some for me, though, I just haven't gotten copies from them yet. No worries on that scrappin' front! My bestest buds were there, plus a couple of their husbands... and a surprise friend who is my LONGEST running friend since I moved here to Ohio. We don't get to spend a lot of time together because our lives move in such wildly separate directions, so it was awesome that she was able to make it. From my friends I got some lovely gifts, including a wonderful art print (she has a different art print in her office that I have coveted) all the way from New Mexico...
My husband Steve was fully absorbed with his new job at Johns Hopkins University, and I was home with a two year old. We wanted friends, but were both hesitant when Steve's officemate his wife invited us to attend their church. We had nothing in common with "religious types," but Steve said, "Let's be nice and go just once."

I’ve loved traditional music since I was a child. One of the themes of the book is what you pass down to the next generation. In an early draft, a character tells Josie that we can still hear the dead talk through the songs that are passed down through the ages. I believe that. I wanted a way to link the book into the voices of the people of the time.

Andi Alpers is on the edge. She's angry at her father for leaving, angry at her mother for not being able to cope, and angry at the world for taking her younger brother, Truman. Rage and grief are destroying her. And her father has determined that Andi's accompanying him to Paris over winter break is the solution to everything.
So what, you ask, are some of these awesome and awfully immature methods for bringing myself to giggles? Oh, I am so glad you asked!

However, Lenka refuses to leave her family despite Josef's begging. Josef has no choice but to leave with his family without her, but he promised her that he would try every means to get them to leave Prague. With this promise and hope in mind, they separated but fate got into their way and each believed the other was dead under some unfortunate circumstances.
Since I started this blog, I have received a number of emails from some dear old friends about what is going on in their lives. I apologize for not yet having had the time to reply individually (I will), but one thing that struck me was how so many of them had a common theme: I want to dedicate my life to Dharma, but I have to do all these ordinary things, so I feel dissatisfied with how both my ordinary and spiritual life are turning out.
The feel is milky but smooth. Really decent. Overall it's like a dark Belgian ale. A surprisingly good little concoction. Smoky, rich and deep.
In the meantime, I meet Don. He is from the Oregon Coast and I meet him thru my family. He comes on like a freight train and I feel so lucky to have someone that for some reason wants to love and take care of me. Other than the years the kids were babies he gave me the best two years of my life.

Since the ribbon is blue, and the sky is blue (oh good, I know my colors!), I wanted to do something to fade out the sky and make the ribbon brighter. I tried it using www.picnik.com to do this, but after I was halfway through, I realized I didn’t like it. It ruined the integrity of the meaning of my photo, and even though it’s a bit harder to see, I like it a lot more. I also liked being able to use my telephoto lens, because the ribbon was at least forty feet above me. But don’t quote me on that, I’m really bad at guessing depth.
Over the last month I have been able to live with people who are way outside of my usual social circle. I have lived with people who seem to be fine with doing no work or going to school to just dodge the recession. Most of my friends have jobs.
Doesn't it just scream sunshine? I plan on making another soon in shades of green and aqua. For the next one I plan on purchasing a walking foot for my sewing machine, which should minimize the kind of twisty look of the edging. I still love it, though, with all its imperfections!
Also, someone has published a book and taken one of my stories called Pillowbook Tale from CS. I saw it in Kindle, and that pisses me off. It really does.

So anyways back to what I was getting at...my son gave me two tickets to see Bobby Curtola in concert here in PA. Now the decision -- who do I take.....so I asked my husband out on a date....and he accepted. Your probably wondering why I was shocked he accepted, well I wasn't sure if he would be interested in seeing Bobby Curtola as I wasn't sure if he like his music. So last night we had our date night....this was another celebration for anniversary. The concert was excellent. The band The Sensational Hot Rods - a 50's tribute band were fa-nominal, a lot of talent on stage last night. A big thank you to our son for getting us tickets to see an amazing Canadian Artist perform live.

I’ve dealt with a lot of burn out in my life. When I was in my early twenties, after working one too many 60 hour work weeks, I quit my job and moved back to Sacramento. I was burnt out. I was so burnt out that before I quit, I got strep throat so badly that I was out for nearly 2 weeks. Back then I didn’t believe that my health was a reflection of what was going on in inside.

I think I will go for a run and not worry about getting home on time and maybe go rent a movie and stay up late and sleep in tomorrow morning :) Maybe I will wake up early and clean thsi house (I know it doesn't sound like nearly as much fun but it would be nice to clean without a 2 year old tornado behind me)
Moving stinks. There are great parts about it. But it's hard. And it never seems to get easier. I should know. In my 33 years on this earth, I have moved 12 times. If you weren't a math major, that averages out to every 2.75 years. That's a lot. My family is NOT a military family, either!
It has been almost a year since I last blogged, and I thought I should update this blog and hopefully be better at blogging. I'm going to focus more on blogging about my training for the half-marathon I've signed up for in June, as well as the normal events life brings.

Not all candidates are up to the challenge but for the most part they do put on a show of family devotion that is there to soothe the apprehension of the voter to at least assume that he/she must be a “good person” if the wife and progeny are willing to stand alongside and smile.

On the other hand, I’ve also been devoting a little bit of time every few days to a mini-comic I’ve been doing to relax and have fun, for the entertainment of my friend’s and I, rather than sitting down and forcing my hands to the keyboard when I don’t feel up to it. It’s definitely not something I’m pouring as much devotion as my main project into, and I’m going for a sloppy, fun look to it, something obviously quick but still with a lot of work into it, something that I’m doing quick and for fun but still making sure I’m satisfied with for the style before I consider it finished. I think this is essential to my improvement as well – learning to make things quick and keep things fun every now and then, and trying not to lose sight in that working on these things are what I’m supposed to enjoy, not force myself to do 24/7.
He began to massage my hand and yes, it was fucking fantastic. I wasn’t quite feeling my clitoris swelling or anything, but it was definitely sensual. I could tell he was enjoying giving me this pleasure – he loved women, all women. He gave me another smile and while continuing to massage me with one hand, he started to rub himself with his other hand. I didn’t recoil in disgust, so he took that as his queue to take it one step further and he put his hand down his pants and began to masturbate. He wore fairly baggy jeans, so it was easy for him to perform this act without having to undress. I was wearing jogging pants and as I sat on my bed with my legs kiddie-crossed I took my free hand and began to masturbate as well. He released my hand and we both focused on satisfying ourselves, however constantly making eye contact that was deep and intense.

Normally I avoid mentioning politics here on StormBringer as it generates Dark Energy within me. However, we are entering into a political season the likes of which we may not have seen since the insanity of the 1968 Presidential elections, and so I address it from a security point of view. Strange players are marshalling their forces, maneuvering into position for what could become a perfect storm of chaos, confusion and extreme political violence.

We arrived by train in Taitung from Taichung on a Monday evening, and set out on the road the next morning. With both of us nursing minor fevers, we made a slow, gradual start. Riding on the coast, we stopped often to take in the view, eat sugar apples (see last post), and spend lots of time chatting with friendly travellers and locals.

One of my favorite parts of the interview is at the very end when Dr. Carson is asked why when he was asked to speak at a Presidential Prayer Breakfast in 1997 but told not to mention Jesus, he did anyway, and when he spoke at Columbine High school after the shootings he was asked not to mention God, he did anyway, and he answers by saying, "I can not separate who I am am from what I believe." He then goes on to say that when Hollywood was making the movie about his life,

But kayak here they do, down both the Swift Current Creek, into Duncairn Dam, and down the Frenchman River through Grasslands National Park in Val Marie when water levels allow. An experience Smith says that allows people to enjoy the park in a different way.
So, that is why I don’t know how to react to Betty Dodson’s statements. To engage with her ridiculousness is to divert my energies from much more important work that urgently needs to be done. But if I chose to be quiet I’m afraid I might communicate to other young brown feminists out there that feminism is still a space of hurt and humiliation for women of color where speaking out is met with personal attacks from older ‘experts’.
No room has been left untouched in my house. Anna is an equal opportunity messer upper. She loves to empty the contents of her room and spread them all around my house on a daily basis. I pick up two pairs of shoes, she brings out three more pairs. I pick up a book, 10 more books magically make their way out of her room.
LÄPPLE: Ratzinger had to analyze Saint Bonaventure’s perspective on Revelation. In those years the debate on the concept of Revelation was very alive. A new view was coming in, according to which Revelation was first and foremost the historical action of God, in the progress of the history of salvation, and could not be identified with the communication of some truths to reason through concepts, as claimed in the
Many of my happiest childhood memories revolve around the Monkees, their music, and their wonderfully campy tv show, so I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Davy Jones earlier today. I'll admit that he wasn't my favorite Monkee ( I was more of a Peter/Mike girl), but I couldn't help but adore him for his musical talent, his adorable British accent, and that impish gleam in his eyes.

It’s easy to hate on Cristina Millian, what with her lack of any contribution to the show and that awful Dip It Low song like 10 years ago… But you know what she has over Carson Daily? The same thing that Ryan Seacrest has over him: ENERGY! With all due respect to Carson Daily, but Dick Clark had more energy a couple of months ago! I’d ask if it’s too soon, but that’s not a joke, it’s the truth! I get sleepy just watching Carson Daily, much less listening to him. Unlike Adam and Ceelo, he’s not annoying, so he can stay, but dump him to the back room to ask the contestants irrelevant questions. Get Cristina Millian up on stage to host The Voice. Sure, she could potentially be a train-wreck, but it would at least be fun!
To this day, Jools Holland has remained as a presenter of live TV music shows (although to a fair extent the audiences have aged with him), and his annual new year Hootenanny shows are now deeply entrenched in BBC culture. The broadcast is well known for providing some of the most watchable performances of the year from some of the truly important acts of the day, and indeed, in some cases, of all time.
I mean who could blame them? We wanted to leave the building too. Must admit though it was a very worrying time and a total relief when we caught up with them at the services just outside Newcastle. Phew, panic over.

How it really happens is like this: a writer and art director are locked in a cage. A creative director opens the cage door just wide enough to throw in 5 pounds of briefing documents, memos, research reports, and old ads. He slams the door, yells "I need this shit by Thursday, and it better be fucking good" and runs off to lunch with his assistant..

Hey, small stores may not be perfect, but we have QUALITY product. There’s also that little thing called service. The last time I walked into Michael’s, an employee couldn’t help me find charcoal. Charcoal!! The kicker is, it wasn’t even her fault, Michael’s is not an art supply store. Michael’s is a CRAFT STORE. It’s like walking into Dairy Queen and asking for gummy bears in your ice cream (true story). People. You are asking a platypus to be a duck.
For MJ, it has always been about multimedia. She has the most amazing collection of music on her iPod, encompassing a huge range of styles, periods, and countries. She writes beautifully and has two fantasy novels under her belt. She uses movies and television as a powerful learning tool (in the process teaching me that TV is not the evil I once thought it was). And she has an eye for image and design that has led her to become a truly wonderful photographer.
Here’s what I saw.

I know I can do a better job of communicating with teachers. I also know that large numbers of teachers believe we are on the right track. I ask that you join me in exerting our energies on the battle to improve student performance, not the conflict between union and district leadership. The latter can, I believe, be resolved with the help of a mediator. The former can only be waged by working together toward the common goal of helping our students succeed.
Now, our kettle is actually broken and won't turn off on it's own. But we make it work, the process goes faster actually since I boil the eggs 5 minutes, turn it off, and let stand 5 minutes before transferring to a bath of cold water.

David was my anchor. He was the one I looked up to, the one I let myself believe in, mostly because he was the only one who stuck around most of the time. Dad was a traveling salesman, a “regional rep” for some company selling medical supply equipment or something like that. His trips started taking longer, and longer, sometimes a week or even two. He said competition was up, so he had to start traveling farther to find new clients. We never seemed to have a lot of money, so I guess we had to believe him. Maybe needed to believe him.

The creator of the Tulip Chair and Table — architect Eero Saarinen -- studied sculpture at Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, prior to emigrating to the U.S. to study architecture. This background provided him with a unique sensitivity to form in his buildings and furniture designs, in which he strove for "consistency and relatedness of all parts." Makes sense that the architect behind the St. Louis Arch and JFK's TWA Terminal was also a sculptor, doesn't it?
In those days at least, either the Government-run National Health Service did not offer a prosthesis, or, perhaps for some reason, she did not qualify.

Sept. 27, 2011 - The girls and I crawled out of the trailer at the crack of dawn and headed straight to the local coffee shop for a buzz-buzz for me, rest stop for them before I drove us all to the ferry. By the time we'd made the 10-minute drive, the girls were already fast asleep in the back seat.

USP: Their lead singer’s notoriety on the celebrity scene has brought them the closest act on the list to crossing over into the mainstream. Their second album got to #6 in the Billboard 200, so you could argue they have crossed over already. They’re clearly striking a chord with listeners, and while the US charts are usually a ‘lowest common denominator’ yardstick, She & Him scaling the heights in charts usually filled with Rihanna’s tiresome, attention-starved, idiotic nymphomaniac act is a joyous moment indeed for purveyors of ‘proper music’. #hipsterrant
Probably because whilst I see my gift as something beautiful some of the single people around me see it as a kick in the teeth to their current relationship status.

Introduced to North America by early colonists, yarrow soon became a valued remedy used by many tribes of indigenous people. American Shakers gathered yarrow for use in numerous medicinal preparations. The plant was listed in the official U.S. Pharmacopoeia from the mid- to late nineteenth century.
John Terry was elated upon hearing that he was to be reinstated as the England Captain. The British government have called upon all footballers in the entire London area that it may be wise to start evacuating their wives from the capital before it is too late.
Before you start wondering, I would like to narrate a recent incident. I was in Bhopal having dinner at the Jehan Numa Palace’s famed restaurant “Under The Mango Tree” when I saw Jaya Bachchan walk in with a few friends & relatives. Obviously all heads turned in her direction including mine but there was no pandemonium. She sat at the next table, ordered food & drinks and they started having peaceful conversations. Once the dinner was over I decided to go and talk to her which I did. I congratulated Jaya aunty for becoming a grand mother and reminded her of my previous meeting with her at the Delhi airport when she was with Amitabh uncle, Abhishek and Anil Ambani – all returning to Bombay in Anil’s private jet post her (and Anil’s) oath in the Rajya Sabha – which she, of course, did not remember but seemed to be happy talking about – and I genuinely complimented on her still maintained elegance and charm! She thanked me profusely and then I requested for a photograph with her. Jaya aunty very sweetly declined saying “it is an extremely private dinner; there are so many people around who too would like to do the same; hope you will understand and not mind … God bless you.” I understood of course and did not mind also! Three days later when I was returning to Delhi, I again saw her walk inside the airport wearing a beautiful dress looking every inch a “Guddi”! She had a bit of harried expression around her. Had she spent a few minutes around, I would have gone to her again, requesting her to pose for a picture with me – this time at a public place, giving her no opportunity to refuse! … Her departure started a discussion about this entire phenomenon called “celebrity-admirer” relationship. And I decided to pen down my thoughts. So, here I am …

More recordings on the way, making up for years of slow netspeed. Kudos to Zongo for life support, Lochner for mikes & much more, & to Fast Freddie for runnin' Video Dick's Record Emporium with the bathroom office full of tape decks.

Mountains of gratitude to Davmar, D.White, Sanchez, Elliot, The Florida Kid, Kloiber, Zingg, JTW, Bershaw, Boston Gold, Weeks, Dixon, Moore, Gough & SO many more for all that collecting & sharing... Royal thanks to The Man In The Palace, Doc Tinker, Brinkhoffs, Barely Eatin', Reel Master Gaule, Parrish & all the traders who housed me thru my music acquisition & travel years. Hats off to Brother Kent, Uncle Jake, Little Queenie (& her neighbor Frank) & his honor Ptomaine Thomas.

Never mind if you got to the end before you realized how bad it was, never mind if that little voice at the back of your head keeps whispering you can fake it ... just do that little thing you do and nobody will notice. Never mind if it's been YEARS. Never mind if all your well meaning friends and relatives keep saying, it only needs a little TWEAK (They all tell you that because they don't want to upset you. A total rewrite is not a tweak. There. I said it).
Secondly, Ananais was “a devout man according to the law.” That word, devout, meant that he was one who exhibited a holy awe of God and found expression in devoted activity. Here was a man devoted to the law and was going to Saul to put his stamp of approval upon him. He was devoted to the very thing these militant Jews were holding in accusation of Paul. From Acts 21:28, the main accusation was that Paul was teaching against the law and the temple. If Ananias supported him, shouldn’t they?
She of the infamous Mr. & Mrs. Redneck, the ones who have provided humorous fodder for me, both written and anecdotally, because if you don’t laugh at a situation like theirs it’s too depressing to contemplate. The last status report from the state of their union came a couple months ago when he proudly stated he didn’t give a damn what she thought or said about it; he’s not leaving until the kids they have now are grown and gone. I guess that means he just bought himself another eighteen years, give or take. Maybe he’s smarter than I’ve given him credit for, what with a sperminating insurance policy like that.

We toughed it out at home that first night. The house was still warm and we were able to keep G entertained after dark by using a few jar candles and a few strategically placed head lamps (hung from wall frames, ceiling fans, etc.). The gear of a bridge climbing husband is very handy in a power emergency. By morning, the house was measuring 65 degrees. We all packed up and went out once again. This time though, the roads were clear, there was bright sunshine and the snow was already melting away. An odd contrast against the green leaves and grass! That night, knowing the temps would drop off further, we took our relatives across town up on the offer of staying at their fully powered home.

Just a few years ago, owning a flat screen TV was a point of differentiation for the most up to date households. “Look how thin it is,” elicited ooh-ahhs of admiration from neighbours and friends. Today, flat screens seem to be as commonplace as toasters and microwaves.
And, after I forwarded the critique to the IBO, the official behind the report told me "we remain confident in our methodology and results."
As of right now, I've watched the majority of the movie Predators in bits and pieces. I like it. Luckily I've got my boyfriend next to me explaining all of the nuances and throwbacks to the original Predator, so that was helpful. Then he found War of the Worlds and decided to watch that all the way through, the Resident Evil after that.

The shot above was taken a couple of hours into the long haul from Sydney to San Francisco aboard a United Boeing 747. Then some hours later, I gazed through my window as I tried to sleep - and sat there transfixed by the colours that began to develop on the horizon, from my vantage point more than 30,000 feet up.
And anyone who has this problem, leave also a comment and tell which background you have, so I could try to fix something...hopefully.
Next up, Dad's card. We all know it is difficult to make those manly cards so if I can't find something to colour I turn to my stash of 'specialty papers'. These aren't your run of the mill scrapbook papers, many are either hand made, or have the look of hand made and of course my treasured Magenta Maruyama netting got on there. LOVE that stuff!
I'll get some pictures up as soon as I get them loaded onto my computer. The other day was the first time I had picked my camera up in weeks! I just needed a break! Things were going way too fast for me, and I didn't feel I was ready for where it was taking me. People were asking me left and right to do family pictures, baby pictures, birthday pictures - and while I love that they love my photos, *I'M* not where I want to be yet, and I don't want to give anything to anyone that I'm not happy with myself.

Reaching the stile I was much encouraged to see that I was a whopping 12 mins inside the 66mins I’d recorded on the test run. The snow along the previous section had obviously slowed me considerably last time. Still feeling strong, I now knew I could get beyond the wall corner by the one hour mark and finish in under 1:45 (assuming no blow ups or bonks). I still had a Go gel in my bumbag so was quite confident on that score.
*Took my first shower today since Friday morning. The hot water felt heavenly. Yesterday I washed my hair in the sink before church. Doug had to help so I could keep the towel wrapped tightly around my shoulders (it was still freezing cold in the house at that point.). First I got my hair wet with the frigid tap water and quickly shampooed. There may have been very loud shrieking. Then Doug rinsed it for me with warm water we heated on the camp stove. Ahhhhh....sweet warmth! Although the clean hair was nice, cleanliness really isn't THAT important when it's that cold. Turns out I might rather be stinky and warm. I'm kind of a wuss that way.

Days like today I get frustrated and even feel pretty low but staying in the state does not help. Become more invigorated and stronger in resolve is whats needed and I can't forget the importance of recovering for illness. We now have 3 weeks until the first round of National trials.

All’s well that ends well, I suppose. But that’s not the point! The purpose of extreme couponing is to save money while providing for one’s family and community. To become a better and more responsible steward of one’s financial resources in order to maximize quality time with loved ones. And I had ultimately failed at doing so by wasting precious time with my son and neglecting to pay a basic utility bill.
During what in retrospect has been a lifelong awakening I criticized and ridiculed political correctness and the liberal illogic behind it without even understanding their origins, pervasiveness, or monstrous power. It was only in the last few years, and especially the last few months, that I have had the time and motivation to dig deeper.
First, we had to drop the coats and bags at the coat check (nice to know that’s free). Then I got the tickets (tip: kids under 12 are free, so if you’re considering joining, no need to go for the family membership) and grabbed the Family Maps,which are at the Information desk and loaded with scavenger-type discoveries and a Where’s Waldo-style Look ‘n Find Map.

The mode of action of a pesticide is also important. A pesticide is either (1.) ingested by the insect by eating it (2.) by grooming itself and ingesting it or (3.) dermal penetrating or soaking through its cuticle – its skin. Well, this is exactly where the problem of control comes up. Bedbugs suck blood, so they don’t have a way to (1.) Ingest a pesticide (2.) they do not groom them selves very often and don’t have the opportunity for ingesting the pesticide and lastly (3.) their exoskeleton (cuticle or skin) is thicker than most insects and the class of products that we have available does not dermally penetrate the skin.

NAMA has never confirmed that it acquired the INBS loan secured by 20, Grosvenor Square but it would seem to fit the NAMA eligibility criteria in the NAMA Act, that is, that the loan was with a NAMA Participating Institution (INBS) and was for development. Although NAMA expects to pay just 30c in the euro for INBS loans generally, it is likely that the agency paid far more for this loan. That said, it is understood that NAMA has made a substantial profit on the transaction.

A child will develop verbal skills at first so they can communicate with the loved ones around them. They will begin to cry in order to express pain, a dirty diaper, or hunger. Sometimes they will cry so they can be held. Their verbal skills develop as they grow so they learn more sounds. Soon they are cooing and gurgling which seem to attract attention. Before you know it, a child will be forming words in order to talk and communicate with others around them.

Updated, 9:24 p.m.: So the recipe isn't an epic failure, just a minor one. The kids hated it, I could tolerate about half a muffin. One of the flours is a bit crunchy - maybe the flaxseed or almond meal? Tastes very nutty... and even though I followed the recipe exactly as I always have, save for the flour substitutions and using less oil - the muffins are waaaay too sweet. I drink sweet tea, love chocolate, dream of pastries - and for me to say something is too sweet, that's saying something.
It has been all but easy getting this far, so it was a joy to Goretti and I to let our hair down a bit and lap up the moment. A brief thanks has to go out to the friends and family who have been so very helpful in the last few weeks and months and to the magnificent team who have helped us get thus far in fullfiling our dream.
But Dante Lamb kicks all those UCLA Yale Hunter Columbia kids' asses. He acheived this when he beginning painting at 2 and selling his first work of art at 3. He was making graffiti throwups in crayon, and then started living on the streets of the NYC at age. Shortly after turning 3 years old and becoming more fearful that he would never gain recognition in his lifetime, he wandered into Deitch Projects and ended up doing some blow with the cute gallery girl and brokered a deal to sell a then unmade ironic videogame inspired painting to a hedge fund billionaire. Oh, he didn't? Well, what did he do? He sold a painting for 85 dollars to a bar in Georgia. That doesn’t count, that’s not special. It's pretty funny, though. I highly doubt he had anything to do with the sale. But that does indicate stardom if you just sit around making art and someone else does the selling. But 85 dollars is hardly professional, though. I mean how does he support himself on a price like that? Granted, he doesn’t live in NYC, or even Brooklyn or Hoboken, but still. I mean come on. Really, folks, please. He acheived this feat in 2002, so at age 7 he might be well considered a mid-to-late carreer artist.

My class has been taking quizzes on the reading as well as doing comprehension questions and character charts. I pass the quizzes easily, because your writing is deep and memorable. Everything about it is exhiliarating and flowing. The questions are easy because when I need evidence I want to go back and reread and take in everything I missed. The character chart was the hardest piece of work to do because everything you need is spread out throughout the reading.
Readers selfishly expect to consume news stories for free and when asked if they are willing to pay for them, they couch their negative responses in the guise of tropes taken from the era of civil protest. "The people," they say, will decide. But what they don't see - because newspaper companies don't routinely talk to the people about their economic fortunes publicly - is that the media is suffering. Those news stories that you rely on for information are becoming a rare commodity. You may not like journalists, or you may not like tabloid newspapers, but if those vehicles for content disappear the society you live in will change for good.

In the end, they went for a bit too much unfortunately. Not even ridiculously high - around £140 at the auction end. But it probably would have cost me nearly £200 just to go to King's Lynn in Norfolk (about 250 miles round trip), pick them up with a rented van and bring them back... and then the cost of painting them and recovering them.... yes, I could have made the money back eventually but I wasn't prepared for the initial outlay. So it didn't happen... sigh.

As I passed into adulthood I began to question so many aspects of Christianity and the Church. I lost my faith entirely and I know deep down that I will never reclaim it. I don't pretend for a second that this loss of faith can all be pegged on a single rapture film, but when you come to God by way of the lion and not the lamb you will always be frightened and unsure. When your experiences are soured by poverty and parental loss such that you can't help but question the motives of even the most sincere do-gooders, you become that proverbial camel on the wrong side of the needle--except that you can't help but wonder to yourself why you would ever want to squeeze yourself back through.

Again, the boy shrugged. Fuckington decided to give up with this simpleton. The nobleman who owned this territory had surely been lax in his role as patriarch.

The book does highlight some interesting issues that will make your peepers pop & kick your brain cells into gear, so yes, in a sense, I am more aware of certain things, would like to try out healthier options, try switch up certain bad eating habits with good ones, but honestly, it didn’t change my life, I didn’t convert to anything overnight. The Power that got me curious to read the book wasn’t powerful over me. I’m not sure if that disappoints me or if it pleases me to generally know better than to have a book convert me as soon as I read the last page.
Christy and Julia are 43 and 45, respectively, so let's get real. In fact, some of us might feel a bit outraged that Lancôme dropped the stunning Isabelle Rosselini as the face of Lancôme at 40, for being too old, and picked up Julia for the same when she was older than that. One might think that's a step in the right direction, but not when Julia still looks under 30 in the ads. When does touching up turn into complete fabrication?
Sources close to Rodriguez told the Mercury he liked new K-State head coach Bruce Weber and was excited to work with the former Illinois coach due to his history with successful point guards like Dee Brown and Deron Williams — who is a current success in the NBA with the New Jersey Nets.

Methods of in vivo diagnosis and therapy and methods of surgery are also excluded from patentability in Europe. For diagnostic and therapeutic inventions it is normally possible to obtain patent protection using other claim types, such as diagnostic or medical use claims. Medical use claims are directed to use of a therapeutic substance in therapy. European practice allows such claims to be additionally limited in many different ways, for example by patient group, dosages, administration schedules or methods of administration, and so a wide range of inventions can be protected. However there are still problematic areas, such as new medical uses of known devices, particularly where an electrical impulse or electromagnetic radiation is delivered (instead of a substance). Other problematic areas are those where the invention is not restricted to use of a specific therapeutic substance or treatment of a specific condition, such as a new delivery system for example. This is because Examiners are reluctant to allow medical use claims which define substances functionally and which are not limited to treatment of a defined specific disease condition.

Up 3rd access and down 1st/2nd access with Jocelyn. It was a remarkably warm day, so I started back to the hills a day early. We took it easy, enjoying the spectacular weather and laying down fresh tracks through slushy snow. Shin felt notably better than it typically has the past two weeks.

I am going to finish my flavored yogurt and bran (with flax added of course) and then a cup of unsweetened tea and then………the treadmill. 45 minutes of sheer fun for Sunday morning before most people are even up.

SANTORUM: Does everybody in Massachusetts have a requirement to buy health care?
This is unlike many other companies I know of who give the front line staff no empowerment and need everything run by the next level or two up. Even for small things. This does my head in – such a waste of time and effort on everyone’s part and 9 times out of 10, you get annoyed customers all the same. Do we really need to check with HQ or the bosses boss if someone wants to bring a small item back for a few pounds or dollars and doesn’t have the receipt, it’s unopened and clearly from that shop? No. Think of the cost of checking and delays. And the experience the customer is having. Not good and as the customer you think twice about using them again.
We stayed at Thanh Long T@n Hotel. 19-21-23 Truong Dnh St. It was strategically located near the shopping center Bien Tanh, touristic spots and food market. After taking a rest for a while in the hotel, we went down to eat.We ate at Pong restaurant, where Bill Clinton had had his lunch a few years ago on his visit to HCMC. In the afternoon, we bought souvenirs at Bien Tanh. Here you can shop using USD. Local currency is called Dong. 1 USD = 16000 Dong.

"... But Glenn Beck is saying something else: "Leave Christianity." Again and again in the Gospels, Jesus mentions our responsibility to care for the poor, to work on their behalf, to stand with them. In fact, when asked how his followers would be judged he doesn't say that it will be based on where you worship, or how you pray, or how often you go to church, or even what political party you believe in. He says something quite different: It depends on how you treat the poor.

My question is: If he’s not God, how then is he perfect? But the JWs say that he was sinless and perfect. I just can’t wrap my mind around there being more than one perfect, sinless, holy being in this universe. It’s just a weird concept for me to grasp. And I have enormous difficulty trying to comprehend how someone who is NOT God could effectively take my place on the cross.

The first day we were here, we had to go to Wal-mart to buy supplies. (Yes, they have Wal-mart up here. Most of the major stores are represented. It's not entirely primitive.) Halfway across the parking lot, the cold began to penetrate my clothing. I was almost to the car and I suddenly realized my fingers and face and legs were badly stinging, the cold was so intense. At that point, my days of Tetris-like organization of groceries in the trunk was over as I began flinging things into the back of the van with wild abandon. Keeping bread, eggs, and potato chips from being crushed gave way to a desperate need to escape the invisible enemies now biting at my skin.

She took a trip to visit friends in her hometown midway through our relationship. I did not join her, and there were disastrous consequences. A few days before she was scheduled to come back, she called me distraught. I asked her what was wrong and she didn’t want to give it up, but eventually did – she was raped by a childhood friend of hers. I went ballistic. I was absolutely livid. If you ever want to see the highest possible rage I can exhibit, rape someone. You had better pray that I don’t get to you before the police will, because they’ll be scraping you off of the sidewalk (and any nearby buildings and vehicles) for years when I’m done.

A man is judged by his friends, a man is judged by those he associates with and a man is judged by those he supports, therefore it is only reasonable and fair that anyone that supported the ANC over the past hundred years be judged by his support of the ANC. It also then stands to reason that anyone who supports and finances terrorists must be a terrorist himself, even if he does try to disguise the terrorists by calling them "Freedom Fighters".
Janna Dutton & Associates recently published an article on the incredible work of the ICBC. Their mission is to achieve and maintain quality, dignified and compassionate care for nursing home and other long-term care facility residents. The organization works directly with families to help choose the right nursing home, shorten or avoid nursing home placement by finding alternative care, improve poor or abusive nursing home care and navigate the waters of Medicare and Medicaid. Their database aides this work by providing information on services various nursing homes provide, their violation histories and the experiences members have had with those homes.

Greg Leitich Smith's previous middle grade novels were pretty firmly located in contemporary school settings, but in his author's note to his new book, Chronal Engine, he says he's always loved survival stories and dinosaurs. That love shows, and so does a sympathy for his young teen characters. They find themselves in a setting where Jurassic Park meets, oh, maybe Jules Verne, with echoes of Conan Doyle's Lost World and possibly a touch of Robinson Crusoe, all of it pulled together with an adventure story sensibility that is squarely and effectively aimed at the middle grade reader. I had great fun talking to Greg about Chronal Engine. Here's Part 1 of a two-part conversation.

Yes, yes, my pet. We were too happy before we began playin’ with the nigger. Lucky knew somethin’ would happen to him when he got home. I understood but listen he shouldn’t have been trusted with his paycheck, while you knew he’d spend it all when he got a chance. Honestly I tried to intercept, pull him back, but I couldn’t stop him, and I know, Lucky, he tried his best, but he just couldn’t. Listen, next year you should be forewarned. Gotta keep us away from dunkin’ the nigger. We was like all those out there, you included and some others who kaint always be expected to control our urges. Of course, dear, I’m ashamed of myself for him (let me clear my throat) for us spendin’ so much of our hard-earned dough, which we’re sorry for now. And we spent the biggest part of it on what? Corn dogs, Frito Pie, almost naked women, and dunkin’ a nigger. Well, it was just money. All the same, listen, Lucky, I don’t in no way blame you ‘cause I was as much to blame as you was. We was just talking about money. There are more important things in life than money, more important things like home and family and you know between us we all know it, that’s the beauty of it, see, we know what’s important in life. It’s perfectly priceless our families. And, listen, now that we’re on the subject, what upset our wives more…most was our Sunday love affair with the Green Bay Packers, and of course, we never made a big deal about it, only on Sundays, and please kindly remember, and never forget that we worked hard all week long.. Ahim. And that was the stupidest thing for ‘em to get upset about…us wantin’ to relax on Sundays with the Green Bay Packers. It was the one thing we shared with our sons. It was the one place where the color of a guy’s skin didn’t matter. Women just don’t understand (you know, dicey). So she thought she’d go crazy, speak of it, and we didn’t hear her. A new Westinghouse mixer would’ve gained us a few points. We could’ve used a few. Let us spend money on them. Harbor no more ill will, Molly. And cease your fummin’ Charlotte. Yes, em, life is too short. We was like most men. We liked our beer and our football. Besides you’ve got your house. Let us have our football.
Anyway, wish me luck.
To be clear, this initiative is not about “dumb custom” – i.e., the “custom that is not customized.” For example, taking a book, ripping off the cover, putting in the faculty syllabus (maybe), and putting a new cover on with the school and faculty member names on it would be considered "dumb custom." Our focus is on “smart custom” – i.e., custom aggregated content that is aligned or matched to student learning outcomes. Smart custom is created in partnership with faculty and linked to course descriptions, syllabi, and accreditation targets for student learning outcomes. It is in recognition that one of the biggest complaints of students is that the faculty member does not use large portions of the course materials required, and also considers where course materials are headed in the future with increasingly custom course material offerings.

But I never think of it that way, unless I'm looking right at the shelves, or the ironing board, or the couch, or around the computer desk. Anyway, I get the bin down, and there it is.

Amongst the claims made against EMI's Capitol Records by Kenny Rogers in his 2012 lawsuit was that the label diverted substantial sums of his royalty income to a ‘suspense’ account, that he received no royalties on records sold through record clubs, that 100% of the costs of promotional videos were allocated against Roger’s videos (rather than the 50% agreed), that $50,000 was deducted as unexplained ‘expenses’, that whilst he suffered international tax deductions he never received the benefit of tax credits Capitol received on the same income, and that Rogers never received any share of performance royalties from his sound recordings (so called “PPL” income). Whilst public performance of sound recordings in the USA does not generate a royalty from terrestrial radio, satellite and internet radio does produce income and globally where radio plays do produce revenue, the income generated from Roger’s recordings must be enormous, Rogers also claims that the record label never accounted to him for one cent of the substantial damages won by the labels against services such as Kazaa, Napster. Audiogalaxy and Grokster.

First, that Stalin was a very effective and highly successful war leader. He made many mistakes and pursued brutal policies that resulted in the deaths of millions of people but without his leadership the war against Nazi Germany would probably have been lost. Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini, Roosevelt – they were all replaceable as warlords, but not Stalin. In the context of the horrific war on the Eastern front, Stalin was indispensable to the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Second, that Stalin worked hard to make the Grand Alliance a success and wanted to see it continue after the war. While his policies and actions undoubtedly contributed to the outbreak of the cold war, his intentions were otherwise, and he strove in the late 1940s and early 1950s to revive détente with the west. Third, that Stalin’s postwar domestic regime was very different to the Soviet system of the prewar years. It was less repressive, more nationalistic, and not so dependent on Stalin’s will and whimsy for its everyday functioning. It was a system in transition to the relatively more relaxed social and political order of post-Stalin times.

Make double the number of servings you need and freeze the excess to reheat later. Some foods don't freeze well, such as potatoes and crisp vegetables, but most -- including soups and stews -- do just fine. Use freezer-weight storage bags or containers, and mark them with the date so you can use them within three months.

Back to reality. I hope that what I felt with Alex was real. That it wasn't the keys or the bridge enhancing our enjoyment of one another's company but an honest to goodness spark. One can never be to sure, especially with ketchup. The tricky thing about dating is that no matter how much you like someone, no matter how many butterflies erupt in your stomach when you see them, no matter how much you really want it to work, it's not up to you; they need to feel it as well. As I'm somewhat of a control freak (I have planned all my dates for the entire summer after all) I'm used to knowing where I stand in the moment and what the next step will be. It's something I'm trying to change and I'm getting better. Step by step, key by key, I'm trying to sit back and enjoy. Even if it brings me to a broken lock, it will have been worth seeing the view.

It may be the curriculum. Look at the nearest public school for this one. All teachers must teach to the curriculum, no exceptions, alternatives, or workarounds. And in recent years the curriculum has been strongly driven by standardized tests and the need to score well on them. This is even more pathetic than the basic idea of curriculum design where a bunch of soi disant experts get together to arbitrarily decide on what goes into the curriculum and what doesn't. Man! I am so reminded of the Council of Nicea, huh? Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, is our cry. O-r-tho-dox-y. Are we in it? Well, I guess! Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, yes, yes, yes!

I wrote a few months ago that I was going to start making Kombucha and I was nervous about how it would turn out. These days besides a bit of water, Kombucha and Water Kefir are all I drink. I'm finally rid of soda in my life and I don't miss it a bit! Now when I drink kombucha I know I'm doing something good for my body instead of feeling guilty everytime I used to drink a soda. Kombucha is naturally carbonated and it is full of probiotics. My favorite way to flavor it is strawberry, but tonight I decided to try blueberry and raspberry for the first time. You can flavor it with whole fruit or juice, but I found that the whole fruit is better. I use frozen fruit for convenience. One thing I've learned is that this is pretty hard to mess up! The SCOBY, converts all the sugar into something that isn't bad for you. You add sugar for a "second" fermentation (or the fruit) to help with the carbonation.

After inquiring for more details about Aashika’s various projects, I learned that Aashika had started her own on-campus student group, called “Stop the Traffick,” at UC Berkeley. But after exploring on-campus student organizations and working for various NGOs after graduating from UC Berkeley, Aashika says she found it “difficult to experiment and pilot my own ideas, prompting me to start my own non-profit. It was risky, but the only way to find out if something can work is to try!” With this spirit, she decided to start her own non-profit and partnered with other, like-minded NGOs who also want to be more proactive in stopping and preventing human trafficking.

I wake up to the hubster calling me, it's 8:15am. My little human alarm clock hasn't woken me up. I lay there thinking maybe she's catching up on all the sleep she's missed out on the past few days and nights. And then I realise, something is wrong.
I’ve forgiven myself for the abuse I put myself though, I forgave my mother for the hurt she caused when I was a child (that’s a different bridge), and I forgave my grandmother for what she said too. But I had to also accept the reason she said “I don’t want anything more to do with you if you stay with him”, she was trying to make me see that he was hurting me, she was trying to protect me. My mother passed last year and I’m glad we had the chance to repair our relationship before she left because it would’ve broken my heart even more if we hadn’t. (I love you Mom, I miss you you’re always in my heart. Thank you for everything you gave me love, support, encouragement and discipline. I never could have done it without you). My grandmother (my mom’s mom) is 98 years old and though she can’t get around like she used to she is still alert and active, our relationship has been renewed and she told me “We love each other that’s all that matters”. Though my relationship with my children is still at odds I love them dearly and won’t give up on them and the hope of us coming together as a family again.

“When you have this level of expansion, you produce two effects: one is the artificial depreciation of a currency,” Rousseff said, according to a recording of conversation with reporters on the presidential website. “The other serious problem is that you have a mass of money that doesn’t go to the real economy. What do you get? Bubbles and speculation.”

We are also painted a picture of the type of person Victor Hugo was and we are even given a glimpse of his children’s downfalls and tragedies. As a reader, we feel sympathy for Charles and Adèle, while admiring Hugo’s talent but questioning his delusional reasoning. I think perhaps what strikes me the most about this tale is that all the events in the book are facts—the way these moments are presented is fictional, but very believable.
Now comes the hard part, picking a name!
1. The foiled firebomb attack this weekend on the home-cum-business premises of Gibson Square publisher Martin Rynja, who in a determined stand for freedom of speech is about to publish Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina, a novel about the Prophet Muhammad's relationship with his child bride, and which Jones insists honours the Prophet and his wife.
Whether it’s sticking to your fitness and nutrition goals, relational, studying, or spiritually, our lives are always filled with these moments of regression. Even though we may lose sight temporarily, the simple solution is to realize what you’ve done, refocus your energy, and get back up. Sometimes, if we don’t catch it in time, it ends up turning into a vicious cycle of doing well, then bad, doing well, then bad. This behavior isn’t good.
For instance, before you read any further, see if you can name the movies that each of the songs were in. All right - how did you do? Eight out of eleven is very good and eleven out of eleven is nearly impossible because, just to make it difficult, one of them is not from a movie. At least not yet-but more about that later.

I've been a member of Sisters in Crime Australia since 1998--my goddess, that's 10 years now!--which has connected me with some great Australian crime fiction. I'm a fan of Kerry Greenwood, Lindy Cameron, Leigh Redhead, Caroline Morwood, and Paddy O'Reilly--though the latter wouldn't describe herself as a crime writer; she just puts crimes in her stories. Beyond the Sisterhood, I read Garry Disher and Shane Maloney and I recently nabbed a copy of The Broken Shore by Peter Temple to take on my overseas sabbatical and see what all the fuss is about. Adrian Hyland's debut novel, Diamond Dove is terrific. Anyone worried about the state of Australian crime fiction should read Scarlet Stiletto - The First Cut for reassurance.
Father Christmas has various companions, one of which in Germany is Knecht Ruprecht. However, not all of his helpers are frightening; the Christkindl, meaning Christ Child, was thought to accompany him in many countries. Indeed, the Christian Christmas story is difficult to separate from these other winter legends.

10 years ago, almost to the day, I packed up my bags and headed for England. At the time I was married to my ‘practice’ wife (the first one), and I was accepting a job offer. Unlike most people in SA, I wasn’t leaving because of politics, or crime. I was leaving because I was offered a kick-ass job in London, with opportunities that were great for my career at the time.
According to the stick in my back yard, we are now down to just over two feet of snow remaining. So we must be close to fishing season and barbeque season–you are following my logic, right?

I purchased khaki flannel (the blue gingham was from my stash) because I thought it would be gender neutral, as well as hide stains well. Prints would hide stains even better, but the solid was cheaper! So far my khaki diapers have no stains, while my gingham diapers have almost faded to white (but no stains!). You can get 1 diaper (two sides) out of every 2/3-3/4 yd. of 44" flannel.

This past week we had dirt and six pallets of sod delivered to try to get areas that have never seen grass covered. It looks like it will take about two more pallets but it will look really nice once it is all done. Unfortunately, as we were trying to spread dirt and lay sod Friday and Saturday we had thunder storms and torrential down pours. It did make having mud fights with the boys a lot easier.
Dear Cerly Grace,
Matthew 11: 28 – 30 “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” AMEN! I know this verse has touched all our lives at the SSiC DT. We are so blessed to have each other to share our burdens and to pray for each other. We know that in taking each other’s request to our Father and leaving them in His loving care allows our hearts to “find rest”. It also is just very comforting to know we have so many “sisters” who care for us and about our problems as well as delight in our accomplishments too!!
All of these assessments, measurements, and tests are essentially designed the same way. When you design a test, no matter what it's purpose, you start out with a goal. For example, the goal of a Driver's License Exam is to ensure that new drivers are adequately prepared for everything they might encounter while driving, so they can be safe. The goal of a pre-employment test is to ensure that the test taker has the aptitude or ability to succeed in the job. And the goal of a scholastic achievement test is to ensure that students are learning the things that the state Department of Education believes they should learn. So, to one degree or another, all assessments start with a "performance standard", a minimum acceptable outcome, in mind. In other words, all tests know what "good" looks like.

AU: The main issue is the people versus the system, and that the former gets more coverage. Obviously, the people related issues are a structural issue, in the sense of issues of power and in service delivery; i.e. people who either lack competence or integrity or both. I am not minimising the people related problems, but to me what is more interesting are the structural issues. If you look at the system as a whole, it does not have the capability to deliver, so it is a system reform that is required as opposed to a change in people only. The second problem is that it is the symptoms which are reported rather than the root cause.

I woke up this morning with this song reverberating through my head. It’s a beautiful song, and the dance routine so elegant. Audrey Hepburn has such poise. However, I do object to her face being called “funny”, as she’s absolutely beautiful, but the sentiments of the song are wise words. It is more important to have a personality and character behind one’s appearance than to always concentrate on the appearance itself.
And while I don't know if that encounter- with your beautiful face and the words of our dear friend Courtney underneath ...
for all of this and more, I am thankful...
Some of our victims spent their entire life savings on these scams. Many of them are elderly or disabled people who were sold a dream that became a nightmare. If Airleaf had no intention of fulfilling their promises, then it was their responsibility to return the money to the authors. No money was returned, but the owner, Carl Lau, certainly enjoyed a plush lifestyle with an airplane and a cabin cruiser from our hard earned money. The Executive Vice President, Brien Jones, was earning a six-figure salary with our money until he decided to open his own publishing company, Jones Harvest. His authors are standing right in line behind the Airleaf Victims, with over 70 documented complaints to date, which you can read about on my website www.JonesHarvestFraudVictims.com.

The story is a wonderful tale about a little boy named Peter who refuses to grow up. He flies off to Neverland and has adventures with his band of Lost Boys. There are pirates and the Indian princess Tiger Lily. One night while sitting outside the Darling’s house to listen to the mother tell a bedtime story, Peter is spied and during his escape he loses his shadow. When he goes back for it, Wendy, the daughter hears him and is able to reattach Peter’s shadow. Peter finds out that Wendy remembers many bedtime stories and asks her to go to Neverland to be a mother to the Lost Boys. The Darling siblings, Wendy, John, and Michael join Peter Pan and the Lost Boys in Neverland.

I do agree with one aspect of LZG's article. If my kids are upset and clearly disturbing the peace in what would otherwise be a quiet place, I will remove my them when possible. But not as punishment, only to find some space for us to figure out what the problem is, and to prevent further disturbance.

Bruce Friedman, who blogs regularly about the use of computers in medicine, also has described how the Internet has altered his mental habits. “I now have almost totally lost the ability to read and absorb a longish article on the web or in print,” he wrote earlier this year. A pathologist who has long been on the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, Friedman elaborated on his comment in a telephone conversation with me. His thinking, he said, has taken on a “staccato” quality, reflecting the way he quickly scans short passages of text from many sources online. “I can’t read War and Peace anymore,” he admitted. “I’ve lost the ability to do that. Even a blog post of more than three or four paragraphs is too much to absorb. I skim it.”

The album many of my friends said he became Prince again. Before this album, he had already dropped the symbol and went back to calling himself Prince. My friends were actually referring to the music, especially the song “Black Sweat”. On this song, he uses his signature falsetto with the lines, “I don’t want to take my clothes off…but I do.” Also, he promises his love interest she’ll be screaming like a white lady at the count of three.

The creature that dwelled deep inside Lyca forest was one that was simply evil. It was the worst type of creature, the one all the other bad creatures cross the road to avoid passing. It was thirteen and a half feet tall, and that was with the hump in its back that caused it to lean over at a slight angle to the right. It was clothed in robes that hooded the creature, that were of a most bottomless and hopeless black and ripped and torn as if they had been through barbed wire. Its face was one of terror incarnate, with entirely white eyes, slits for nostrils and a wide, gaping pit for a mouth that constantly hung open as if it were howling with misery. It had teeth that were broken and jagged, skin that seemed to not be large enough to fit its face and therefore appeared stretched and peeling. It was, in short, horrifying.

Ultimately, what it all comes down to is the ability to engage the players in a dialogue about their actions in game, and their reactions out of game. It means being able to gauge everyone attention span for the evening and (going back to flexibility!) playing down the creepy ambiance in favor of simple descriptions and head-bashing combat. Or playing UP the ambiance and dialing back the combat! Or dropping extra hints about where to find the next clue, or having the cute tavern owner make googly eyes at the character who’s been quiet all night and might need some attention, or realizing that no-one is interested in your scenario about rival gangs in the town they just came to for supplies. But they ARE interested in finding out why the local temple has closed its doors to the public!

In the second half, Chef Bastianich shares her recipes for a number of favorite holiday cookies, from Almond Butter Cookies to these babies:

Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen write anthems about the travails of the working man; we line up for the revival of “Death of a Salesman.” John Mellencamp and Willie Nelson hold festivals and fundraisers when farmers suffer. Taxpayers bail out the auto industry and Wall Street and the banks. There’s a sense that manufacturing, or the agrarian economy, is what this country is really about. But culture was, for a while, what America did best: We produce and export creativity around the world. So why aren’t we lamenting the plight of its practitioners? Bureau of Labor Statistics confirm that creative industries have been some of the hardest hit during the Bush years and the Great Recession.

Sitting here reminded me of the hour stolen before teaching last Thursday: writing the scene where this elusive character revealed himself, pulling the long unused key to his parents’ house from his wallet, his men turning away in denial of how his hand shook, scraping the brass face of the lock before he could turn the key. The house of the death he’d caused, the main character still thinking him a victim while the shear act of turning away had revealed to him that his closest friends had thought him at fault all along.

If there is any type of “war” going on it’s the new anti-men movement. To the ladies waging this campaign against men, I’m begging you, please: drop your weapons. You are fighting a losing battle, and ultimately, you are harming yourself and the female gender. Regardless of your sexual orientation, you need men; you can’t live without men. Moreover, I believe a portion of your disdain for men stems from internal strife and discontent.

My favourite review “Real Steel is constructed from two incompatible movies that should never have co-existed: serious science fiction set in a plausible near-future and a gooey, sentimental family drama.” Richard Edwards.

All I could think about was how it was wrong and how I couldn’t fix it and this made me a terrible employee and on and on. And in the grand scheme of things, it’s really not that big a deal. But I couldn’t stop myself from thinking I should do something more to fix it. Go back to the (empty) office. Send emails (to people I knew couldn’t fix it). Call my boss (who was already home, and couldn’t fix it from there, and whom I already emailed). I was able to see that all of these thoughts were completely irrational, though, and when it started to turn into what a terrible employee and, therefore, terrible person I was, I forcibly distracted myself and the thoughts subsided.

It has been stated that the Agency Underwriting and Processing guidelines are going backward to some degree, toward the manual underwriting process, one small effort at a time and the rules and regulations are being made to ensure that an applicant can carry the increased debt they are about to embark upon. Fannie, Freddie, and FHA are all emphasizing that it is the lenders responsibility to verify anything that is questionable with regard to the mortgage applicant's application. Anything that might prevent the performance of a loan must be questioned and documented. They are being upfront with the fact that there are instances when there must be additional information verified to make certain loan applicants have the willingness, capability and capacity to pay back the mortgage loan.

For by acting in a manner that they believe will allow them to increase in complexity (to continue living, growing, and developing), organisms value complexity. Evolution, however, does not ‘value’ (more on this sort of valuation) merely complexity, but robustness, that is, the ability to make complexity increase in a sustainable manner. This is why robustness, which is composed of both complexity and sustainability, is essential for network ethics. Organisms value complexity, but the overall goal of evolution is to create organisms that value robustness. The gap between one state and the other, the valuation of complexity and that of robustness, is the separation between evolution as it is and evolution as it strives to be.

On Friday, each of the survivors of last year's 24th Street corridor assaults received greeting cards with notes and messages of support, along with a $4,000 check from a fund established for their benefit by the Fair Oaks Community Coalition. Cards and checks were delivered by the District Attorney's office of Victim Assistance. One of the women, who has been aided since the attack by close friends in Noe Valley, asked those friends to share this message with the community:

Just one thing. I noticed in the newspaper the other day that you had a 3 billion dollar contract for media that you did not give to an American company. Funny that there is not an American company you could use. I always thought we had a pretty good advertising industry here in the USA.

The last time was today, and most notable against pocket kings. I mean, I do need to refine my game ALOT, the person raised, I reraised him after the flop, and he went all in. There was a King on the board. I honestly put him on AK, but honestly, should you really lay that down in heads up ever? I mean, yeah, I guess I should have layed it down. But the odds of that are very very very slim. I’ll take the one loss every 12 times I am dealt the hand. But I have taken most peoples advice, bet it heavy and early. Because in the end it is just a pair that can be taken down by 23 off suit if the flop dictates.

The million dollar question is when will we see it in production. It’s no secret that Toyota’s CEO, Akio Toyoda, known sports car addict and driving force behind bringing the extravagant LFA to market, is enthusiastic about a Supra successor. The project has not be officially approved but if Toyoda had his way and the economy continues to show signs of recovery, the new coupe could be on showroom floors by late 2015.

Back in the mists of time a British Pro Cyclist was as rare as bees knees - however there have been some famous names that have come from these isles. (Please note I’m going to include Ireland throughout this blog - this is because I don’t understand politics and so (in my head) they count). Mention the names; Tom Simpson, Sean Kelly, Robert Millar, Sean Yates, Chris Boardman or Stephen Roche, and most cycling fans will know who they are. However these big names were few and far between.
Unlike some of the other True Romance palettes, all 8 shades are powder shadows. The inky black Lucifer is the anchor shade in this otherwise neutral palette, which makes this a day-to-night-possible palette. Just smoke things out with Lucifer and you can possibly turn a neutral office-friendly look into a smokey night-out look.
Therein lies the mystery. One should always beware of the obvious, and with so many commentators patting themselves on the back for their perspicacity – including me – there is the danger that we are missing something.

Since watching a number of episodes of The Electric Company (yeah, Netflix!) she completely understands the concept of the silent E and while she doesn't know yet which words have a silent E and which don't, if she is struggling to say a word and I tell her "silent E," she can immediately say it; she knows exactly what each vowel should sound like in that situation. I think it's really cool how easily she learned that and how well she knows the vowels' different sounds. The Electric company has also taught Sweet Pea how to read words with 's or 've or 'd, etc. at the end. She doesn't yet fully understand possessive uses of apostrophes, but she totally gets that "doesn't" is a contraction of the words "does not." It is incredible how easily she picks up some of this language stuff!

In July the Prime Minister announced a two-part inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, investigating the role of the press and the police in the phone-hacking scandal that emerged last summer. Leveson has since suggested that police officers should write down all meetings they have with journalists in a notebook that will be audited. He has also advised officers not to talk with journalists outside of work.

I give NEVER credit for fully taking on the idea that James Bond is getting old. They don’t pretend that Connery can still do everything now that he could do two decades earlier and the film is built on this idea that Bond has outlived his youth. He’s called on the carpet for his lifestyle, he’s forced to start taking better care of himself, he’s spent the majority of his time teaching instead of being in the field, and the world is ready to move on without him. The problem is that whatever they thought in 1983, in 2011 we kinda see the point of the bookish M’s complaint. There is value in working out and eating right and if Bond really hasn’t do any of that over the years, then he should darn well start sooner rather than later.

Over active emotions were destroying me peace of mind and more than any other emotion I had anger issues. Anger, one of the most spontaneous and difficult emotions. Anger is a very strong emotion, not easy to handle either. This often gives it a bad reputation to anger and people often place it in the list of negative traits.
It’s fine to say take a bath, get a massage, work in the garden, get your nails done, call a friend, read a book. These may help, and are certainly valid suggestions, but they generally aren’t as quick, cheap, available and effective as food and drink. Yes, we self-medicate with food, and booze, but sometimes one needs that medication to get through the day – or night – right? At least, it sure feels that way sometimes.
So yeah, you won’t identify with these characters. My students won’t show up in the fall telling me “I am sooo like Shoshanna!” the way they did ten years ago with Miranda, Carrie, Samantha and Charlotte. (There’s even a nice scene in the first episode in which Shoshanna burbles about which character she identifies with.) These girls haven’t figured out what they want, nor how to get it. They’re full of borrowed, would-be sage advice picked up here and there — and they’re quick to criticize each other — but they’re floundering. It’s kind of amazing.

At least one member of the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed. "Personally, I think the dog-scent stuff, particularly as done by Pikett, is junk science and should never have come into court," Judge Cheryl Johnson said. Absurdly, prosecutors told jurors at trial that the dog-scent lineup was "as good as DNA." Winfrey's attorney, Shirley Baccus-Lobel, told the CCA that "The problem with bad science masquerading as science is it results in attaching a significance to unremarkable events." San Jacinto County prosecutors told the court that although the case was circumstantial and "parts of it are weak," they should uphold the conviction anyway. (I know, you're shocked.)

Last week Mali’s political scene appeared to be moving in the right direction. Prime Minister Diarra’s transitional government was finally named, and the CNRDRE junta in Kati was keeping relatively quiet, having gone several days without arresting anyone. Even the power outages that were daily throughout the first half of April had become rare. Most regular Bamakois I knew — i.e., those not involved in politics — were satisfied that the state could at last get back to dealing with urgent matters, most notably Mali’s de facto partition after separatist rebels last month took over the northern half of the country.

I read an NPR article recently which suggested that, every once in a while, we should turn our minds “inside out” and think about things from the opposite perspective. It listed some examples of things done in other countries that are opposite of the way we do them in the US. One such example is that, in some parts of China, people pay doctors for the time they’re healthy, not when they’re sick. Some Chinese doctors emphasize preventative care, so if their patients get sick, it’s said that the doctors haven’t been doing their job and therefore don’t get paid.

That said, I have booked some personal training sessions for myself this week, for yesterday and tonight, and I’m planning on going to personal training sessions three times a week from now on, to get my butt into gear and to finally lose masses of weight instead of a couple of pounds here and there. Right now, I wish I could take a few months off work so I could personal train for six to eight hours a day (cough), just to get to where I want to be quickly but I can’t, so this is the next best option for me. I cheat when I’m in the gym. I say I’m going to do 25 minutes of Cross Training or whatever, but I will always slyly decrease my time because no one is watching me do it. So I need that trainer there to tell me what to do and make sure that I do it. This will be my way of life for the next few months, and at the moment, I am dreading it because I know, to start with, I will feel completely knackered before I feel completely awesome.

I wanted to have an authentic Japanese new year as possible, so my friend and I watched Kouhaku (Red and White), a variety music program that's on every 31st of December. The colours represent two teams of performers, and at the end there's a vote to decide which team did the best. The team leaders/presenters were Arashi for the white team and a very pretty actress for the red team, with performances by Kouda Kumi, Wada Akiko (who seemed to be on Japanese television for the whole of my two-week stay), EXILE, Lady Gaga, AKB48, a lot of enka singers and of course SMAP. And lots more besides!

Two of the prominent stereotypes discussed in the film are the “dragon lady” villainous stereotype and domesticated servant, newswoman(i.e.:Connie Chung), etc. While the 1988 60-minute film focuses on the earlier portrayals, the 2011 30-minute followup focuses on depictions from 1984 to 2009. The films were produced by Asian Women United. It serves as a comprehensive complementary piece to Jeff Adachi’s Slanted Screen about Asian male portrayals.

Find yourself a comfortable running outfit that won't ride up or rub in certain areas. When you start running long distances you'll notice right away when the tag of your pants or shorts is suddenly irritating the heck out of your skin. You also don't want to be self conscious or tugging at your clothes the entire time you are exercising.
There was a post by a blogger called Wugan that talked about applying Restricted Free Agency to raids. Basically, WoW players would be ‘contracted’ into a raid team and could not join another team for a set time period unless their Raid Leader chose to let them leave. Wugan accepts this would not force people to actually raid, or stop them changing to alts, but feels this would reduce the incidence of people leaving a guild for greener pastures. It wouldn’t. I don’t believe for one second this would make the life of Raid Leaders easier. Think about why people leave a raiding team and how Restricted Free Agency would affect them:

She grew up in Haworth, NJ and attended Northern Valley Regional High School in Demarest, NJ.
When I got ready to take these photos for you (the ones of the Afters, taken just now), I discovered that at some point, one of the cats got to the photography screen, the folding screen we got at the UU Church Garage Sale years ago. It had one tear in it, which I carefully mended with white glue, and all was well. Sometime here in the last few months, though, someone got to it where it was stored behind the door against the wall. I'm guessing Clarice:

This blog has become almost my weight watchers meeting with myself, MPD style. I know it can help with others but I personally cannot stand exercising with friends, or dieting with them. I never feel like I can go at my own pace. Since I have been well, I have been to the gym every other day and have started to Zumba on the days I don’t gym and every morning I do sit ups. I am keeping to my exercise routine, hopefully as well as my diet. Through calorie counting I have discovered how much fat are in simple things and have been so shocked! I have recently been using flora cuisine for cooking rather than olive oil, to find it still has 10g of fat per tbls! It’s absolutely shocking. However I am keeping everything in moderation, and only snacking ever on fruit. I still have not broken my trend of no chocolate, chips, and cheese. Cheese has definitely been the hardest, I absolutely love cheese. However having not had it, I haven’t actually missed it that much and it makes such a difference in calorific value of sandwiches. Even chocolate I haven’t missed that much, which I think is mainly do to my thinking towards food now. Before I saw junk food as good, something tasty and fulfilling now when I am on the cross trainer watching some stick eating a bar of galaxy, I don’t want the chocolate I would rather have her body. Such a small thing but it makes such a difference.

It was brewed using the infamous Brettanomyces yeast, which gives wild ales their sour flavors. After fermentation was complete, Brabant was aged for 8 months in used Zinfandel barrels.

In order to deal with the trouble they're in, these stores have changed up their inventory. For example, they'll add a "Build a Bear" section or maybe sell CDs or DVDs. That limits the number of books they can stock. They also choose to stock books that are BIG bestsellers. So you'll see a whole wall of, let's say, Vampire Academy, but they won't stock some of the smaller titles, like Blood Coven, because they're not as much of a "sure thing."

In the past, I know I would have felt a little more upset over the idea of not winning NaNoWriMo on time. But I understand that, well, life happens. This year's novel idea has been a little half-baked anyway, and although I do like where the plot is going, I just have not felt inspired enough to work on it every day. Well, it's okay; nobody's perfect, and I'll keep this in mind for next time.
It’s always important to remind people to check the database once a year. My staff is wrapping up getting all the new names into the system from last years’ reporting dates. We are also gearing up for the new safe deposit boxes to come in for inventory.
When she collapses in Portersfield, Texas, exhausted, ill, and hungry, Sheriff Cory Muldoon finds her and takes her to the doctor. Against Cory’s better judgment, Seth and Erin Winston take her in and offer her a job as a nanny for their young son. As a minister, Seth sees it as his duty to take care of her. As a deputy, Cory needs to know the truth about her even as he is attracted to the waif of a young woman.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would effectively stop the building of most new coal-fired plants in an industry that is moving rapidly to more natural gas. But the rules will not regulate existing power plants, the source of one third of U.S. emissions, and will not apply to any plants that start construction over the next 12 months.
Aside from being a horribly clichéd action-movie pose, there was no goddamn reason for it. They had just defeated all the enemies, quite clearly. They weren’t even close enough to fall into it naturally, Ayase slid backwards really quite far to do it. And because they’ve defeated everybody they just kinda… stand there for a bit. It is an utterly awful attempt at trying to make the characters seem ‘cool’, and my lord did it fail miserably.

Well, in today’s other lesson from Paul’s letter to the Corinthians, we may have a starting point. The first sentence of that reading is “Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?” 1 Cor. 3:16
More to come on my save-the-date ideas. For now, here's what I've been thinking about for our outfits...
You have attempted to at least mock some of my posts but they were taken out of context such as J’s post which was talking about how Christ stated many times that he talked in metaphors instead of in a literal sense in fact the sentence I stated about that before was very clear. At the time you were not discussing science. Makes me wonder if you read any of the comments against you.
Because it deals damage faster the longer it attacks, the Void Ray is best used against large units—capital ships and buildings. Carefully controlled, however, the Void Ray can be powerful against smaller units as well, if it charges its attack to level three first on a larger unit. This means the Void Ray should be a very micro-intensive unit. You’ll have to constantly choose the right targets to attack.

The Mentor/Shadow program should be obvious – in a country this large we need to develop as many top level coaches in every discipline that we can across the nation. I would even look to develop Regional Coaches Directories, along with Regional Coaching Development Programs that put coaches like John Smith, Alberto Salazar, Bobby Kersee, and Dick Booth together with their peers to exchange information/techniques. This should be mandatory for all coaches who want to work on international programs – because we want to replicate their success, we want as many athletes as possible benefiting from their knowledge. Similarly the Athlete Referral program would take elite athletes and put them in touch with coaches that can help shore up their weaknesses. For example, while a Walter Dix has his own coach, he (and his coach) could be referred to Jon Drummond for analysis and tweaking of his start mechanics. Again, without disrespect to their personal coaches, acceptance of referrals should almost be a mandatory component of competing on international teams. As we want those athletes competing in the Red, White and Blue competing at their absolute maximum potential.
Re-reading any book from a distance of 30 years is interesting, particularly since I am now an author myself and my Muse has developed a sharp critical horn. So it is a testament to Anne McCaffrey’s warm characters and imaginative storylines that sentences such as: “Resentment replaced the sense of loss as Jaxom found himself, loyal to Robinton’s precepts, trying to rationalize this wave of unpalatable reflection” melt seamlessly into the story, and I can honestly say I didn’t notice it when I devoured this book as a teenager!
Sony is one of the most successful competitors in the video game industry. Its consoles have created a great consumer loyalty since the release of the Playstation 1. It continues to hang with the best of them with consoles like the Playstation 3 and the PS Vita.
According to a new report by Delloitte Consulting, the outsourcing of services requires a complex series of tradeoffs: cost savings versus growth, speed versus quality of service delivery, and maintaining organizational cohesion versus knowledge and innovation. They note that 70 percent of the participants have had negative outsourcing experiences and have either revised or are revising their outsourcing outlook, strategies, and tactics:
Scarlett Johansson, who reprises her role as Black Widow in this Friday's Marvel's The Avengers, was honored in Los Angeles with her own star on the Hollywood walk of fame. While the ceremony represents a culmination of well over a decade of cinematic work, several of Johansson's Marvel Universe co-stars were there to cheer her on, including Jeremy Renner and Clark Gregg!
My best friend called me today. She lives up in San Fransisco. She is the one I went to Ireland with. Her husband called it quits on their marriage about a month after we got home. She just found out from her son that he proposed to another woman in Hawaii. She didn’t even know he was dating. He asked his son not to tell her even though the son had met her family and gone on trips together. Blindsided would be an appropriate word I think. But I’m proud of her too. For us. For making it this far.
If you find yourself invited to her table, keep you mind on the conversation and not on getting a date with her. Most women want to know what kind of person they are going out with long before they actually go out with them. Make an effort to get to know her and give her the opportunity to get to know you before diving in for a date.
All these different "whites" are, in fact, very pale colors.

- Discovering something new about myself
Here's a last little note about context: The next stage of human (cultural) evolution involves the reinvention of the generalist (the role of philosophers in the enlightenment comes to mind as an analog). In the past 100 years we have delved deeply into many areas of reality, both through science (Einstein, Heisenberg, etc.) and through religion (Martin Luther King Jr., Mohandas K. Gandhi, etc.). It is time to integrate all that we have learned and to purposefully apply it to the world which we create every day.
"So you go out, you look at an industry, you find people violating the law, you go aggressively after them. And we do have some pretty effective enforcement tools.
Looking at a map of the route to Muncho Lake, you would think that Highway 97 (a section of the Alaska Highway) is a pretty major roadway... after all, this is the only road that directly connects Watson Lake to Dawson Creek. Well, this is true for the first 110 miles or so after Watson Lake. But right around the Liard River Corridor, the highway abruptly changes to a very narrow, two-lane road with lots of ups and downs and sharp curves. But, despite its shortcomings, Highway 97 along this stretch has a pretty good road surface and the countryside is just gorgeous and so it really was a pleasant drive.
I hope to outgrow this habit soon. It gives me the equivalent of a coffee headrush. Mind gets out of whack, and my brain felt like it had just bungee-jumped without the lifeline.

Merpel, on the other hand, points out that she has much less sympathy with the patentee. Didn't he have several timely reminders and a total period of 9 months during which he could have paid the renewal fee? If he was so cash-strapped not to be able to afford to pay renewals on time, how much was his patent really worth, in its 13th year? Merpel thinks that this case is a good demonstration of why one should not play the risky game of leaving things to the last minute.

The first basic colour mix consist in taking a green colour from a tube and altering it. A drop of Vermilion in a pure green will remove any acidity from the original colour and bring it to a more neutral shade (because green and red are complimentary colours). Experiment with other red colours, like Alizarin Crimson, as well as pink or orange hues and discover the range of muted greens you can obtain. To lighten a green, try to add some Yellow Ochre to it – rather than a yellow hue – to obtain more natural greens.

Martin came to my show every single Wednesday when he was in town. I believe he was flying the New York route regularly from somewhere to NY. We were young then and I think Martin was around 22 years old. If I can be so bold, I also think Martin was maybe gay, but perhaps not out at the time. If he wasn’t, my apologies. When I say such a thing, it only means that you are extra special in my eyes. All I know, in truth, is that Martin loved my show and that I loved him back. I mean he beamed when he was at my show. He was such a warm and loving person and just about the best audience member you could ever meet. I don’t mean to speak of Martin, as if he were dead. I don’t believe he is, since he should be a bit younger than me right now. I’m speaking of him in the past tense because we have lost touch with each other, but I have NOT forgotten him. Here’s the thing you need to know about Martin, he made my show better. Just by being there, he made it better. When you sit in an audience, some people do so passively, but Martin never did. He was fully present and alive during my show. I noticed it and I appreciate it to this day.

As weird as it sounds, I do not truly remember the exact moment I made the conscious decision to bring the boys home. I just remember that sometime over the course of that Easter weekend, I knew, in the deepest part of my being, that the boys were supposed to come home with me. That I was supposed to become their mother. That we were supposed to become a family.
I’m working on further novels for adults, too – a possible sequel to ‘Charity’s Child’ and a science fiction novel set in 2031 and 2222, which will take up my interest in AI and robotics and may well be ‘experimental’ in structure. And I have a novella called ‘Mondays with Marguerite’, told from the point of view of a woman with Alzheimer’s. It’s looking for a home – novellas are notoriously difficult to place.

Three men with arms like legs approached me. "Are you English?" They'd observed me apparently cracking the code of the Turkish phone system - 5 minutes puzzling over a huge, flabby directory in a dingy Istanbul post office, 1984 - and getting as far as making a call (to the British Embassy, unsuccessful). I clued them in on how the phones worked. "But what's that?" said I, peering intently at their T-shirts, from which protruded their Olympic scale arms:

Deputies searched the area and based on a detailed description of the vehicle, a Ford F-250 truck, they located the suspects driving west bound on Highway-192. They continued to follow the vehicle at a distance and observed the vehicle travel at a high rate of speed and run through a red light and a stop sign before it attempted to drive through a wall opening at the dead end of N. Lavon Avenue in Kissimmee. The vehicle crashed into the wall and the suspects fled on foot, but were apprehended a short distance later.

“No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.”
In one way, that is all fair enough. The old saying "A conservative is a liberal who was mugged last night" embodies a similar idea and represents a claim that conservatives often make: That they are more realistic and that Leftists are dreamers who need to be brought down to earth. Being vividly reminded of your own forthcoming death (which is what the psychological experiments concerned do) should invoke a similar burst of realism and disable dreamy views of life.
I already have two favorite designers too - Sarah Parrott & Orly Shany. Sarah's designs from the past two weeks were both bought by H&M. I'm in love with the Bright Blue Backless Dress and the Tuxedo Trousers, and with a thrifty price of $19.95, I'm dying to get my hands on both! Orly Shany's Zip Mini Skirt was bought by Sak's and was so unique and innovative! I was shocked when her design from last night wasn't bought by anyone. It was a convertible dress that could be totally transformed.

So life is made up of good days and bad days. Yesterday was a good one :) Nothing outrageous happened but things were simple, sweet and I took time to appreciate how great life is. Studio was busy, classes were awesome and lots of new members signed up!! I came home and Tanner was sleeping even though the cleaners were buzzing around and vacuuming right outside his door-he just slept like a champ(for 3 hours-he never naps that long-it was heaven!!!)!! Kevin got home early and so we walked the pups then had a glass of Chardonnay on our patio. I spent a lot of time while preggo on our patio reading and relaxing and it was so surreal to now have this amazing baby sitting on my lap bc it just feels like yesterday that I was rubbing my bump and feeling his kicks out there.

She’s really not keen on working alongside other fashion designers either because when they’re using the same inspirations they can start to come up with very similar ideas and Judy loves her creations to be unique.

There's a belief that to do great work you need tranquility and control, that the pram is cluttering up the hallway; life needs to be neat and tidy. This isn't the case. Tranquility and control provide the best conditions for completing the work you imagined. But surely the real trick is to produce the work that you never imagined. The great creative moments in our history are almost all stories of distraction and daydreaming – Archimedes in the bath, Einstein dreaming of riding a sunbeam – of alert minds open to the grace of chaos.

It was not until 1858, however, that the old Capitol was renovated, reconditioned, and recycled (yes, it was a “green” city even then) into this new configuration. City business was transacted on the second floor of this new building, while the Market House, which was probably some sort of store or exchange, occupied the ground floor.
Anyway, my friend is back from Jamaica now, so my Mum Sitting duties are over and I've got some time to myself, and once my chores are done ( Yuk! ) I hope to do some crafting.
I don’t win out of turn, but when I do, I salute the crowd. Once I got carried away after nosing out a broom-handle-up-her-arse woman in a stiff white power suit, and I made it all the way to the National Gallery before realising I needed to get back to scale.
This morning my almost-four-year-old and I went to Freddies. It was a typical Saturday morning at Fred Meyer’s: busy busy busy. The parking lot was pretty full.
I hate don’t you, hate it when you have a precious day off and yet tired though you are, you awake at the same time you would for work, your body fatigued, yet your mind akin to some cruel taskmaster denying the body much-needed sleep. You will of noted from my last post of course my complete and utter loathing as to the plight of man in this area, that is to say toiling constantly to fill the coffers of the treasury who themselves tax us to pay the money-powers. I fully realise that my toil is almost in vain and that my body aches so that others may gain, those others the newcomer, the shiftless, the duplicitous politician and the banker.
This is a show that is probably in the almost completely safe zone. It should be back unless something weird happens.

And yet I’m not sold on it. My pores look the same as they always have and always will do. My skin looks no more even than it did before. I can’t pass judgement on wrinkles obviously... And then they go and whack in a fairly strong fragrance too. It’s a little bit reminiscent of cucumber but really quite noticeable. If you have dry skin, £57 for 30ml is in your budget and you don’t mind strong fragrances you might like this. If you’re expecting a miracle cure for enlarged pores I wouldn’t hold my breath.
On our way out, I gave myself a shoulder pat for staying calm and having managed to smile despite all the foul language he had thrown at me. At us, the locals. Then a face-palm for saying ‘thank you’ as a response to his ‘fart you’. I mean, Addie, thank and you? Really?
The Oakland Police Department said in a statement that the crowd was ordered to disperse after protesters “began destroying construction equipment and fencing . . . Officers were pelted with bottles, metal pipe, rocks, spray cans, improvised explosive devices and burning flares,” the police statement said. Officers responded by firing smoke and tear gas canisters and beanbags . . .”
Then we come onto the piece online. It's got a byline, but I wonder if it hasn't just been recycled from some press release. From the headline suggesting brewers, having 'cashed in' on real ale (which brewers? How?), are now turning to 'lager', the hopeless paragraph containing a potted American brewing 'history' claiming that craft brewers owe their success to Prohibition (if Horst Dornbusch had written this, Ron Pattinson would be all over him), and the inexcusable confusing of ales as lagers (even setting out the full name of SNPA - a beer Tesco has listed for some years now, by the way - surely a clue in the name, lads?). And poor Iain Loe of Camra may have to wear a paper bag on his head for a few days after being quoted in this rubbish.

This may be surprising to some, but I am not 100% opposed to the idea of banning children from certain restaurants. Before you start thinking that I've lost my mind, let me explain. I do not agree with the practice of banning children in any way, shape or form, but I feel like it is that business owner's right to set the rules for his/her establishment. If he wants to make it "adults-only" then I think he should have that right. However, I think it is a very slippery slope. Also, by banning my kids, you are essentially banning families - and I can't imagine that would be good for business. My biggest issue with the concept is this: where does the "banning" end? We had rules and laws like this at a point in time and it was called segregation.
Ever wonder how much it would cost today to book passage if the Titanic still sailed? What about wanting to know who first spotted the wreckage underwater? Or who the youngest survivor of the shipwreck was? Or even what the newspaper headlines said about the tragedy just after it happened? In her new book, Titanic, Melissa Stewart offers readers the answers to this diverse set of questions and more. As part of the popular National Geographic Kids series, Titanic is brimming with stunning photographs, detailed diagrams and illustrations, and primary source material. Everything in the book, from the fascinating “Weird but True” factoids scattered throughout the pages to the double-page spread discussing “10 Real Reasons Why the Titanic sank”, whets readers’ curiosity. Furthermore, Stewart’s lucid prose and focused details help young readers apply their developing reading skills to pursue authentic inquiries. In all, this early reader book tailors an impressive array of information for students across the grades and reading levels to partake in deeper explorations and share in commemorative classroom activities about the famous ship.
So many people are happy to have their children go off to school in the Fall, I've always said that I would miss mine! Parents talk about how awful the teen years are, I love talking with my daughters and their friends! I've heard so many homeschooling parents talk about how hard it is to get their kids to do the assigned work, I say why not just unschool! It makes me different. It doesn't mean I'm not accepted by the people that I know, just that they don't understand where I am coming from, and much of the time I don't understand them!
I call this the "score and scoop" method. It's easy to do and works really well.

In addition, I have seen only 2 or 3 peahens, one of whom had 3 of the smallest peachicks (Is that the right word?) I have ever seen with her. The disappearance of so many peafowl has made The Ancient One wonder if the goal was to eliminate the flock rather than just thin it out. In the absence of a public outcry, I guess I'll never know.
I don't know if this piece has any kind of value today. Maybe the fact that the whole set is now dismantled, must decrease its value. And although such ensemble was (and still is) far from cheap, my mom paid only half of its retail value because she could get it directly from the factory where one of her friend worked back then.

None of this should be taken to imply that there never was any debt at all. Rather, it means that when this debt mysteriously refuses to go away no matter how many immigrants are allowed in, and no matter how much Britain is demographically transformed, then it has become a fake debt, an instrument used to cudgel the ex-imperial master around the head and induce him to allow the ex-imperial subjects to escape the squalor, corruption, poverty, and violence that, they now realize, tend to ensue when they are left to their own devices.

As I may have said before, t's only within the last 30 years that Charya has been performed publicly; previously it was restricted to Newar Buddhist temples. The mudras and songs that are the origin of modern Charya are still performed by the Vajracharya priests today.

Their song “I Am A Shadow” was a great introduction for me, and I hope it will be for you, too. The song is apparently about one person who feels a sense of solitude that won’t go away, even while being mixed in with an endless crowd of people. Yet even through it all, he doesn’t lose hope. (Emooooooo. But I looooooove it.)

“At some Ivy League schools last year, up to half of the graduates went into finance or consulting, a move that could have a profound effect on the economy in the years to come.” Crum, any civilization that does this to itself deserves what will happen next. The very brightest, who do NOT fall for this trap will simply leave the country. A genuine “brain drain.” Leaving the finance twits in charge of a society that explores nothing, invents nothing, produces nothing except paper

From the foregoing, it seems probable that sometime during 2012, the demand for new dwellings will outstrip the current overhang of supply in many areas. If balance is to be maintained in the housing market, then as a starting point, lands in such areas currently held by NAMA must be released for development in time to avert this shortage.
So, I am trying to use up my scraps, so I started with the small square in the right corner...it is a floral pattern that matches the stripes from a Echo Park Springtime paperpack. Since I am using floral papers...She is my flower power gal as challenged by Joanna Sheen. I browsed the challenge blogs to find a sketch that would work and found it at Sketch Saturday. I subsituted the ruffled dark purple for a paper in the sketch, but I like it. I found it a bit challenging to use this sketch, because I made this card into an easel card. (This is only my second time doing an easel! Don't know why! I love them!)

Soup or Bisque? Traditionally, a bisque is a soup that contains shellfish but traditions are made to be broken. According to Wikipedia, "bisque is also sometimes used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the ingredients are pureed or processed in a food processor or a food mill. Common varieties include tomato, mushroom, and squash bisque." So, yes, bisques can be compassionate!

When states held their constitutional conventions, New Hampshire suggested an amendment stating that “Congress shall never disarm any citizen, unless such are or have been in actual rebellion.” In the Massachusetts convention, Samuel Adams unsuccessfully suggested an amendment that Congress shall not “prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.” In Pennsylvania, an unsuccessful proposal from Robert Whitehill held that “the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals.”
Let me close by mentioning the dessert section. There were cakes behind a refrigerated display, with some pinoy kakanins on top of the ref. Beside it was a crepe section, and on the rightmost was an ice cream freezer. To handle the demands, there was one member of the staff that was cooking the crepe while scooping ice cream and handing out the requested cakes. She was in so much panic that she didn’t care if the chocolate slice over my cake fell and didn’t make it to my expecting hands. How could I complain when you could clearly see that there was a long line at the crepes and ice cream section too? And apparently, panic makes you forget that you can’t use the same plastic glove to prepare the food and scratch your nose.
In the same way that we fall into the arms of a loved one or drop our heads on the pillow at night, we can surrender into the beauty and truth of who and what we really are. Falling into Grace is a book that gets to the core of why we suffer. It is Adyashanti’s invitation “to be taken by a moment of grace and fall into a sense of life when it is not separate from you, when life is actually an expression of something indefinable, mysterious, and immense.”

After speaking with the staff at the local elementary school, we were asked to help them put together an earthquake preparedness plan, as well as give a talk on recycling and a first aid workshop. After working with the staff on day 1, we put our plan to the test first thing the next morning doing a full earthquake drill with the entire school. We couldn`t be happier with how smoothly it all went and the great reception we got from everyone.

3. today is laundry day. In doing said laundry, I noticed one of my daughters didn;t have any clothes in there. And since I know she wore clothes last week, I know she has laundry. So I went to her room, and found all of last weeks clothes wadded in her drawer, and under her bed, and on her closet floor. No, this isn;t a new thing. We do this every week. I toss her room, pull out old clothes, and she get to fix it. But for some reason, it was more irritating today.

Next stop was Banila Co, one of my favorite Korean cosmetics brand. They’re touted as the Benefit of Korea, and are priced slightly higher than other brands such as Skinfood/The Face Shop/Holika Holika. I’ve purchased and enjoyed many of their products in the past, so I was really excited to visit their store in Myeongdong. I made my rounds in the gorgeously decorated store, and found these products in my basket. lol.. The It Natural BB Cream and Prime Primer Hydrating seemed to be the newest releases as they were prominently displayed in the store. I really liked their let me bebe BB cream so I wanted to give this new release a try. I also do enjoy their eyeshadow palettes, which are often LE, so I took this opportunity to pick up a few of those still available. These are great for travelling as they are so compact and comes in a great range of shades.
Once again, not knowing even approximate ages for many (most, really) makes it difficult to assess the situation. I find it hard to believe that Roger is old enough to have been around at the time of the mass memory loss, ditto for Beck, so it seems unlikely that Beck’s ‘Memory’ is actually from the past. But that calls into question – where the hell did it come from, then? We could question if we really believe Beck about it, too, but there’s nothing to indicate that he is lying, and, anyway, what does he have to gain by lying? After all, last we were aware of, people who admit to having Memories are not safe in Paradigm City.

It's that time of the year, when they suddenly behave more like siblings than classmates. They have spent a lot of time together and it's starting to wear on them and to be honest, me too! Listening to them argue over the littlest things is tiring and the tattling has suddenly become relentless. I hated to do it, but once again I've had to pull out....the tattle jar.

So we’re a little off the topic of cleaning and organizing, but the torrential downpour in Dallas made me think about being prepared for floods, tornadoes, or any other kind of home disaster. Being prepared for the unexpected is a big part of being a responsible homeowner. Whether your daughter forgets to turn off the bathtub and it floods your flooring, or you lose your entire home, it’s important to be prepared and to have a plan of action ready and available for your family to follow.
What can everyone take away from this episode of the Stupid Boss Files? That owning to your responsibilities in everyday life will help you build your integrity. Integrity helps strengthen personal relationships as well as professional ones. Teaching my children about integrity has been focus area for me – especially where my youngest is concerned. Her ADHD and anxiety make her a particular target for irresponsibility and I cannot emphasize to her enough that everyone makes mistakes, but what will set you apart from others is your ability to own up to your mistakes and to take your consequences with dignity.
This act struck a chord with the people of Sidi Bouzid. In most Arab countries, corruption, injustice and oppression had been the norm for decades. Residents of Sidi Bouzid began protesting on the streets, raising their voices for dignity and justice. Despite a crackdown by the Tunisian government on the demonstrations, other Tunisians in other cities heard the call. The movement spread like wildfire via Facebook and Twitter. By the time Bouazizi died on Jan. 4, 2011, the demonstrations had nearly reached Tunis.

All in all, the concert was an appetite-whetting prelude to the international tour of “Einstein on the Beach” that’s underway this year in honor of the work’s 35th anniversary. The dazzling video work in this production by Mezzocchi and Saeborjsson begs the question of whether Wilson will be updating “Einstein” will digital projections (I could see it going either way). We’ll just have to tune in when the tour hits the U.S., where it opens at BAM’s Next Wave Festival on Sept 14-23 and makes it first-ever (!) West Coast debut in Zellerbach Hall at UC Berkeley Oct. 26-28.
The club has also donated to Habitat Riverside, volunteered for several projects, and held a benefit concert on April 14, 2012 at Back to the Grind café to raise awareness and funds for affordable housing.

Patience is the most important and most difficult virtue when considering our shopping. Consumerism is based on impulse buys and tickling our acquisition bone. The longer you can avoid the instant gratification temptation to buy stuff the moment you think of it, the more things will simply filter out over time. Then you’re left with things that were worth the wait to buy. You’ll probably find a good deal, find a cheaper alternative or at least thought more carefully through your purchase.
In retrospect, we find one very important common denominator, seen throughout this unique historical collection of artifacts. That is, that no matter when or where Srila Prabhupada and his Krsna devotees appeared, the mood and message was always the same — it was kirtan, bhajan, harinama sankirtana in the mood of Prabhupada and the Sampradaya Acaryas. No matter what sort of music was going on all around them, the devotees steadfastly preserved Srila Prabhupada’s mood in sharing our Krsna Conscious culture. Srila Prabhupada delivered the transcendental sound vibration of the Hare Krsna Maha-mantra purely and sweetly, and his disciples followed suit.

As many of us know, October is all about the boobs and this year we celebrate National Breast Cancer Awareness Month’s 25 year anniversary. More than just a time to don your pretty pink ribbons, it’s a time to become better educated about risks, treatments, and preventative measures against breast cancer as well as a time to celebrate the strength, resilience and for some, the memory, of those who fight and have fought this disease.

Many Americans on the left thought the sinking of the Reuben James to be the sort of wake-up call that would push Germany-favoring Americans to reconsider, and people undecided to side with Britain. The political use of the incident didn’t have much time to work. Five weeks later Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and by the end of 1941, the U.S. was at war with the Axis Powers.

If you’re just in monitoring mode, of course, you won’t start engaging; you’ll just be listening to what people say about you. You may be tempted to engage, but we recommend that you wait until you’ve listened for a while, and until you’ve got a plan for how to approach both the supporters and the detractors. Get your social computing strategy together first before engaging. It’s too risky to do otherwise.

Today is also Friday the 13th. The reason I am a believer in the weird mysteries of this day is because weird things happen every time. Today my kids slept in until 8:30am! This has NEVER happened.

It's only lunch time, so I have half a day left to get through this odd day.
I'm ready! How do I sign up??
It makes me angry to think that he can say those words the first time and it’s supposed to magically make me not angry.. The first time he says it, is to soothe me over. That makes me wonder if he actually does mean it. Its okay. I can take it..
I hope to take each day fully aware, not to sleepwalk through my life , missing opportunities to brighten another person’s day in some small way. To perhaps lighten their load , as others have done for me . To be full aware of the human condition in all its frailty.
So, it is December already! I can’t quite believe it. This year has shot by. I’m not going to get all nostalgic just yet, I leave my end of year round-up till the end of year normally. What I am going to do, in the spirit of bucking a trend, is lay out my plans for the coming year. These are not resolutions, merely things I would like to happen (a few of which definitely will)
Band leaders aren’t the guys that get the glory. They give the glory – stepping out in high time to celebrate the team, to honor the school, to send a chill down your spine and rouse a cheer on your lips. It’s a generous, selfless role – and nobody played it better than George Parks.

I resent that in my society which made us not touch each other: after my mother died, my father, thinking me male, was embarrassed to hug me, we shook hands when I left until I forced a hug, and then he was self-conscious. I resent that which exalted intellectual analysis over intuition, mocked and belittled as “Women’s intuition”. I resent kyriarchy. I resent all those who by their action or inaction perpetuated these injustices, this waste of talent and potential. I resent those who use religion to control and constrain, where “The Truth shall set you Free”.

After seeing the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan show when he was just 10 years old, Jim Keller knew he wanted to be a musician. Having been drawn to Ringo, Jim started drumming along to songs on the radio on a makeshift drum set that was comprised of upside down wastebaskets until his parents set him up with formal lessons. While in junior high, he played percussion in the school's marching band and by the age of 12 he was making $25 on Saturday nights performing at weddings. Then in high school he was in the jazz ensemble and orchestra.

I had an extremely stressful senior year of high school, when I actually thought there was only ONE college in the WHOLE WORLD for me. I went to college loving math, but not knowing if I wanted to major in it. It seemed like it might be too hard. And I had trained myself not to try things that I might not be awesome at when it came to academics. I needed to be the best.
This was true of one man I met at a gas station. As he was pumping gas for me we chatted about the usual things. Everyone wonders what a light skinned girl is doing in Chile. I explained why I was there, then began to question him about his faith and family. He enthusiastically announced that he was a Catholic Christian. I smiled happily and by the look on his face I imagined that my apparent approval of his confession of faith had assured him of his sinless state and much heavenly bliss to come.
Here's the Winner for Last Week's Challenge
I want to make it clear to the West and to the German people, which is still being blackmailed because of what Nazism did to the Zionists, or to the Jews. I say that what Israel did to the Palestinian people is many times worse than what Nazism did to the Jews, and there is exaggeration, which has become obsolete, regarding the issue of the Holocaust. We do not deny the facts, but we will not give in to extortion by exaggeration. As for the Zionist holocaust against the Palestinian people, and against the peoples of the Arab and Islamic nation – this is a holocaust that is being perpetrated in broad daylight, with the coverage of the media of globalization. Nobody can deny it or claim that it is being exaggerated.
When SDS member Marilyn Webb dared to stand up at the National Mobilization Committee to advocate for women's rights, she was laughed off the stage with catcalls and cackles of "Take it off" and "Take her off the stage and f**k her." After her appearance, her life was threatened.

I watched “The Beaver” tonight and that’s the theme. My title might have reminded you of the graduation speech at the end, if you’ve seen it: “What if some of human experience is just something that you inherit like curly hair or blue eyes? What if pain is just in your DNA and tragedy is your birthright?” I’ve grown up with these questions in and around me.

She told me she had been listening to a talk show on a local radio station when the DJ had addressed her directly and told her that he was going to open up her head and get inside. She had taped the last 30 minutes of the show and begged me to listen to it and prove that she was not mad.
I started this blog as a way to continue writing, which I love, and to share views and topics that mean a lot to me, which range from books and movies to the environment and other societal issues. Sounds like a grand plan (at least to me) but I'm finding it easier said than done. This blog is a way for me to get my voice out there and hopefully find others who feel the same or who share the same interests I do. All too often I read about news and happenings that make me feel discouraged about what's going on in the world, and I'm thankful for all the people out there who post things about everyday life that put a smile on my face or make me think a little harder about the life I'm living. This blog, for me, is a symbol that there are people out there who also feel that there's a lot to be improved and hopefully inspire thoughts and ideas that help us cope better, and make a difference in our own little part of the world.

Christopher Nolan's "Inception" is currently the internet film community's Rage du Jour. Continuing a battle over the merits of Nolan as a filmmaker that began two years ago with "The Dark Knight", this was also one of the few films being released in yet another barren summer movie season that was worth seeing and talking about. Anyone who knows me is probably aware now that I consider The Battle Over Nolan a low point in film discourse on the web, where both sides of the "debate" have descended into hyperbolic nonsense as if there was a victory to be won on the matter. His films are often wildly misrepresented to simply fulfill a narrative each side wants to create about his abilities as well as those who disagree with their opinions. Either Nolan is the filmmaking genius who is the heir apparent to Stanley Kubrick or he is a complete hack responsible for the downfall of motion pictures.
I had to stop by Target the other night. Needed 3 different kinds of soap (hand, body, AND face...being a girl is so fun), and some new mascara and concealer. So I dropped by the store on my way home from work, and made my way through the aisles with my teensy list.

But this weekend, even alcohol didn't seem to have its usual assuasive effect on me.
Now, that’s what I call a gamble well lost.
When I answered the phone, an automated voice announced the name of the survey. Years of thoughts appeared in my brain in one instant. I thought of all of the questions I could answer truthfully and was thrilled to have the opportunity. In the same instant, I realized the questions could be loaded, my answers misconstrued and something wonderful would be compromised by the corrupted data.
Then last but not least is my 2nd sponsored child :) He is special to me because on the last day I was in the village, I went around and met all the families that got a tank as part of our "Water Tank" project. While meeting the family across the street, George spotted a little boy and called me over to the driver's side of the van. He told me that he had been trying to help this little boy, whose Mom & Dad had abandoned him and who was living with his grandmother. He had already been raising money to buy him clothes and would really like to get him in school. George asked if I thought I could get a sponsor for him and I told him that he was looking at her :)

But where is all this headed? Beckett’s characters notoriously fail to reach an end, whether it be Mercier and Camier winding up exactly where they started off from or Vladimir and Estragon who never even leave their starting spot. The question here is: Will the guy in the bed ever get out of it? As the work progresses we start to figure out what he’s doing there and who “the kindly hands that brought nutrition” belong to and it’s really not that complex. But I won’t spoil it.

Darts are there to shape the skirt - obviously - to your own contours preferably. You can put any number of darts into your skirt, but for the basic block, there will be 2 at the back and one at the front. This translates to a total of 6 darts in your skirt. We're putting more darts into the back as there is more ease there, if you remember.

There was a large manila envelope waiting for me on the dining room table this morning. I recognised it immediately. I’d addressed it to myself a long time ago.
Second, I urge you to read it. Read it with your kids, if need be. Explain to them(since you find it so reprehensible) why you believe what you do, and use it as a learning tool. If you can read it, with all historical context in tact, and still support the opinion that it’s harsh, and in bad taste, then do so. Let me know how that goes. Also, if you read it, and you believe it’s so reprehensible that you don’t want your kids, or the next generation reading the “uncut” version that you read — I ask this. What happened to you? Did you have an experience so awful that you couldn’t bare to face the next day? Probably not — and I’d even be willing to go out on a limb and say that, if you really were concerned about your children’s well being, and not just being over protective, or just plain idiotic — wouldn’t you want your kids to learn the same lessons that you did? To better them as people, and allow them to grow, and not be confined to stricter constraints than you yourself even faced?
So, what to expect? I’ll still update the blog from time to time with any interesting news I stumble on, likewise I should be attending the Eurogamer Conference in late-September so be sure to check out my thoughts on any upcoming games I get to play. Finally, assuming Lovefilm send me some actual games rather than countless movies, the occasional review may be posted up – just don’t expect any feedback on brand new releases.
The second person was Norman Grock. Norman and I met and corresponded through a group called, Zero 2 Illo. I was immediately impressed by his imagination, characters and skill level. Norman has the rare talent of not only being able to create characters but also being able to build worlds and universes from his imagination. His work explores the young male imaginative fantasy world in a beautiful and fanciful way. After the group was over we continued to speak with one another critiquing our respective work and new pieces. We shared childhood interests and inspirations that made us want to draw. Needless to say of the group we would be the ones to geek out over comic books, fantasy, video games, MegaMan or sci-fi movies! Norman is a hard working, witty,sarcastic and intelligent individual with a heart of gold. Again, the stars were aligned for me when he expressed interest in my project.

Of all the deaths of all the people I've never known, probably known have impacted me as much as the death of Andrew Breitbart. He was a true pioneer and warrior in the quest for truth and excellence in journalism. And of course, because of this, he made an abundance of enemies, probably more during his all too brief career than any one hundred people amass over the course of their entire lifetimes.

- Narrative communication involves no fewer than four basic perspectives: the author who fashions the story, the narrator who tells it, the audience or reader who receives is, and the characters who enact it. Where the narrator is practically identical with the author, as in Homer or Fielding or indeed the Bible, the discourse therefore operates with three basic relationships that constitute the point of view: between narrator and characters, narrator and reader, reader and characters.
When you are working on the elements of connecting with fans through your bios, your blogs and your content, make sure you are relatable. Good bios these days are not all about the music and the resume of the musicians. Good bios are now including aspects that help the potential fan and audience connect and relate on other levels.
Earlier this year in an interview with Ad Age, Mr. Turtledove was complimentary of DDB and touted having its account consolidated at a single holding company.
It was in November, I think, that we got a copy of a registered letter Mr A sent to the syndic. In this letter, he requested we call an immediate urgent AGE (emergency assembly) in order to sort out the renovations of the shared areas, and shared services.
Danny and I introduced ourselves to Darlene, we hugged, and she called Bobby over. We had a chance to talk for a second and Bobby thanked us for blogging about Melt Mobile and his show. COOL! Back to reality, though. We gave Darlene our order: two Originals (plain) with bacon, sautéed onions, mushrooms, and tomatoes. A few minutes later we had our sandwiches. They were cheesy and nice n’ crunchy like grilled cheese should be! The ingredients were fresh off the grill – the crispy bacon added a nice texture, the onions great flavor, and the tang of the fresh tomato and the earthiness of the mushrooms balanced the buttery/cheesy goodness out. Seriously amazing grilled cheese…we will DEFINITELY come back whenever possible!
I’m scared. I can say anything to anyone to their face, and frequently do. But writing is so permanent and so potentially hurtful.

I chose to participate in the Newton Challenge because it's a run that's like no other. And I thought, completing this 25 km course of multiple, erratic elevations would be good motivation to start the brand new year. I’ve read a lot about the Ammah Hills and I still don’t understand the reason behind this moniker. Regardless, this was one steep, fierce mama. Looking at the race map, I was also slightly intimidated by the names of some major points along the route as well, like PUNCAK Jalil and Paragon HEIGHTS. They do sound high. So, the Newton Challenge is not just about conquering the distance, but more significantly, it’s about one’s ability to defy gravity.
Spiritual Warfare, Power & Authority discusses: The purpose behind knowing Satan’s schemes and strategies; defining and identifying Satan’s strongholds which can be spiritual, emotional, mental or physical, and can affect our spirit, soul (mind, will, emotions) and body; understanding our position of power and authority in God’s Kingdom that enables us to stand against and defeat the enemy; explains renouncing.
So, meet Eugene and Lucille. You may remember them from an earlier post. Well at that time they did not have names and it took me a heck of a long time to come up with them.

Some anthropologists even believe that mankind’s change from nomadic hunter-gatherer to community group can be attributed to the discovery of the effect that wild yeast had when it infected this source of grain in the right temperature range which then got rained on and magically produced a foamy beverage which, after a few bowls, made Mrs Grog start to look pretty good. For the staying put and planting of crops to make beer - and perhaps some obscure food products, like bread - is thought to be the turning point of civilisation.
So I pass time at the nursery and the plants do their part in keeping me sane. But once in a while, it's the plants that also drive me to insanity. I'm talking specifically about my recent acquisition of an Asian pear tree here. There were no outside forces at work that resulted in it now residing on my patio- only me and the tree. In the moment before I brought it home, I was entranced by it. (My husband, and possibly my neighbours, who I dragged into the garden to admire the tree the moment I got it home, and maybe even some folks out there on Facebook, may argue that the trance lasted all night.) Am I crazy, or did this tree speak to me?

I spent the next seven days (and nights) getting to know this little guy. His schedule (he had none), his hunger cries (very similar to his every other cry). His pirate look--one eye open, one eye squeezed shut, as if he was still surprised by all that had taken place to him in a week’s time.
The eggs he set aside. A small pan had been heating on the second burner of the hot plate. Rainer saw it was wispy with smoke. There was a square platter next to the plate, filled with day old rice. The addict scraped the rice into the pan, to sizzle in the thin layer of oil. Smoke stung his eyes, and the faint nutty aroma coming from the pan reminded him for some reason of his grandmother's kitchen. A trace of grin as he stirred the rice. The only seasoning he had was a small amount of dried chiles he kept in a tan stoneware jar next to the hot plate. He sprinkled a small pinch over the rice, the dark red flakes seeming like spots of blood against the dirty white of the rice. A wave of dizziness overtook him; his head he rested on the wall. Blood. That would be his penance, the dark communion he would receive to atone for his sins of abuse and gluttony.

The legendary promoter Jack Good encouraged Jess to go into the studio to cut some sides, even though singing was not one of the rising star's strong points. The song chosen for his first recording, a cover of Skip And Flip's US hit Cherry Pie crept in to the bottom of the Top 40, but his third single, Mystery Girl, managed to break Top 20 in 1961. Jess managed to scrape into the charts with one more 45 the following year, but after that his chart career was at an end - although he has since managed to carve out a very unique career for himself. This very track appeared in the film Rag Doll (1962), a crime drama (released in the US as Young, Willing and Eager) in which Jess played the role of Shane. In 1963 he landed a major role in TV series The Human Jungle, a weekly drama which starred later Pink Panther actor Herbert Lom in the lead role of psychiatrist Doctor Corder. In the second episode of the series Corder was called in to deal with the problems of rock and roll star Danny Pace, played by Jess. Several numbers were recorded specifically for this programme, released as a Decca EP in 1963. These days Jess is still active, appearing regularly on TV, on stage (he's played Jesus!) and even at the occasional rock'n'roll or 60s revival show. He's also recorded albums with a bunch of pals under the name The Showbiz XI, the same name of his long-running (more than 40 years now) charity football team.

Here are some shade comparison swatches for you; MAC Cockney is a good example of a 'true' red, Berry Rich just looks pink next to it! Sleek Cherry is definitely darker and a bit more purple, with Inglot no. 58 being the closest match. However, I find Inglot to be a bit more of a raspberry pink, whereas Milani is leaning towards strawberry; does it make any sense to you or are you just picturing a fruit salad now?

L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time: To be honest, I can’t recall when I first read this extremely pivotal book, but, since I’ve read it probably twenty times since, it scarcely matters. This book is amazing in every possible way. I recommend it to all – young and old. My senior high school English teacher told me that she read it first when she was thirty years old, and she read it again each year afterwards, and found something new in it each time. I couldn’t agree more.

The success of the whole structure was extremely sensitive to the size of the axle. While a narrow one would reduce the amount of friction, it would also be too weak to support a load. Meanwhile, a thick axle would hugely increase the amount of friction. "They solved this problem by making the earliest wagons quite narrow, so they could have short axles, which made it possible to have an axle that wasn't very thick..."
When faced with the notion of a second tour, the soldier's body language says one thing - what he actually does runs completely counter to that.

Here's a quick peek at the inside. I had this vanilla piece that was a bit too short so added a few layers of dotted scallop trim and some more Ridinghood Red taffeta ribbon to finish it off.

As the Doctor points out in his confrontation of Gavrok, the Bannermen are totally opposed to life, they only seek to destroy:
When I started my paranormal novel a few years ago, it was in March. When I started each book in my midgrade fantasy trilogy, it was the end of February. When the novel I’ve just finished first appeared, it was late February/early March. And now it’s happening again.

With luck winter should be a bit more peaceful on the social front so more can be done around the place, such as finishing the new vege beds. I'd also like to tackle building a furnace and a smoker over winter now that it's fire season again, though that will have to vie with woodchopping in order to keep the place warm, so I'm not holding out too much hope! Doing at least one of the projects would be good!
I originally joined Facebook to promote my blog and I recently discovered that my friends on Facebook actually read it. That was a pleasantly surprising discovery because I don't even look at people's pictures. When I would check out Facebook, I breezed through posts wondering why I cared that someone was excited to watch the new season of Mad Men. I do want to keep in touch with people but I prefer a nice long e mail or phone conversation or, better yet, in person over a beer. It's probably why I like blogging because I get to know people through them. And, you can drink a beer and read blogs: truly a win win.
Long story short (guess it's too late for that), this is a cool thing to do, but only if you have the financial resources to use - aka rental cars, food, plane tickets, time off work, etc. Plus there are several people selling their time shares online for a lot cheaper and for more credits.
I will also have to do a bit more research on John Fisher, the son of one-time Labor Prime Minister Andew Fisher. According to Cahill’s piece on Lockwood, his friend Fisher was active around the Spanish Civil war. He could have come across anti-Stalinists and Trotskyists in that context, like George Orwell did.
Fact: My appetite for different goes unsatisfied in typical exchanges with Black Americans.
To end this bizarre/random post on a different note, I had a photo shoot with my sister and her son on Wednesday morning and I am unfortunately only allowed to share a few, so here they are:
For the rest of '77 Caldwell posted some wildly pedestrian numbers but did manage to sneak his way back into a rotation. Then in '78 Mike became the yin to the Yang of Bambi's Bangers. He was super stingy in giving up hits and walks and levered the much better Brewers offense into a 22-9 record and a 2.36 ERA and probably would have won the Cy if not for Ron Guidry's amazing season. What he DID won was the AL Comeback Player of the Year and endearment to the Milwaukee fans. Mike wouldn't match those numbers again but he did pretty well the next four years, going a combined 57-39 with about a league-average ERA, including a 17-win season in '82 when the Brewers went to the Series. He had an awfully good Series against St. Louis, going 2-0 with a 2.04 ERA, though he came out on the losing end. In '83 he won 12 although the ERA popped half a run and in '84 as the Brew Crew was running out of gas he went 6-13 in his final season. Mike finished with a record of 137-130 with a 3.81 ERA, 98 complete games, and 23 shutouts. He went 2-2 with a 4.03 ERA in six post-season games.
The Shinshu plant was opened in 1985. Its main brand of single malt is called "Komagatake" ("pony mountain"). If that name rings a bell, "Kai-komagatake" is the name of the mountain which the Suntory distillery Hakushu draws its water from. However, their are loads of pony mountains across Japan, and the "Komagatake" referred to here is a different peak in the Kiso mountains. Prior to 1985, Hombo's whisky operations had been at Kagoshima on the Southern Island of Kyushu, where it had originally begun its whisky line in 1953. The company is still selling a "Satsuma" single malt from that distillery. Incidentally, Hombo have their own version of the Masataka Taketsuru creation myth stressing the role of Kiichiro Iwai (岩井喜一郎), who had a role in sending Masataka to Scotland and received his report when he returned. Iwai helped set up Hombo's whisky operation, which was originally based at the Kagoshima distillery which, although its single malts are still on the market, now produces only shochu.
That's going to be hard actually, because there's so much that happens in this book that is major important, and it leaves very little I can talk about. I would say this is probably the most important book in respects to Kaylee's life so far. It's a turning point in the biggest way possible. Everything's changed. Everything. And it's brilliant!

Topshop is a high street brand I've never directly associated with mori girl style. But with the popularity of vintage-inspired fashion in the last few years, most mainstream shops have come up with vintage-inspired dresses that mori girls may like.

The US Navy used that intelligence, along with intelligence gathered by agents on land, to take and hold critical Mexican ports. This enabled US Army troops to land at Veracruz, Mexico for an expedition against Mexico City. (See Two Lines in the Sand: The Mexican-American War Part III)

Bangkok’s first luxury destination spa, the Sukhothai, offers a wickedly indulgent “Five Elements Cleanse and Purifying Ritual,” in which Tibetan and traditional Chinese medicine mingle with ginseng and lotus blossom. The treatment begins with a pebble and herb foot wash that evolves into a water-chestnut body cleansing. The purifying sage, licorice and chrysanthemum bath mixture softens the water for total surrender. After I emerge, the therapist massages me with warm Tibetan oil and then wraps me in healing clay. The bed is broad, so there’s no chance of floundering limbs – such a buzz kill. The treatment finishes with an argan oil body moisturizing, which means you’re greasy and loving it.
Belgium has brought the world many beer styles. Hefty abbey ales, dubbels and triples, fruity lambics, and sour geueze usually grab most of the attention. But Wit or white beer is the delicate flower of the Belgian beer scene that fits perfectly when the weather starts to turn warm.

Traditional Chinese physicians did not learn about the structures of the human body from dissection because they thought that cutting open a body insulted the person’s ancestors. Instead they built up an understanding of the location and functions of the major organs over centuries of observation, and then correlated them with the principles of yin, yang, qi, and the Five Elements.
Today I'm being aided by our main Chocolate Coconut Acolyte as she reviews three of the ten bars we're looking at. These three in fact: Almond Joy, Mallow Cup, and Cup O'Gold. Two of these I've heard of and two of these she heard of -- the same two. Neither of us was familiar with the Cup O'Gold from Hoffman's so I'm looking forward to learning more about that one in particular.The words in italics below are from her, our Chocolate Coconut Acolyte, I've only changed the fonts and added in her own photos as well as some historical information.

Ian Ashmore, Head of Environmental Regulation at Sheffield City Council said: “The illegal tobacco trade has a huge effect on our community.

I knew then that I was in labour and decided I should probably shave my legs. Didn't want to scare off the doctors and nurses with hairy legs after all! I took a bath around 3:00 pm and barely felt anything as far as contractions went. Then..within a matter of minutes, I was suddenly in excruciating pain and we called my mom-in-law to come look after Connor. She lives an hour away though and there really was no time..or it felt like it so we called my friend Heather as well. She rushed over in the nick of time because we had decided to just take Connor with us to the hospital after I told Jeremy I needed to push!

All these and more factors in human existance are turning negative, because the human race is concentating on “ego” instead of God. So He will continue to take action to change the focus. It will be up to Him whether He will allow a remanent to exist to restart a new human world or whether to just kill off Humanity. If we humans can change in time, this might help him decide.

Children, regardless of age, need to be taught that their actions and words can have a profound effect on other children—in both a positive and negative way. Who is responsible for teaching this crucial bit of Humanity 101? Adults. Adults must take the reigns here and lead the way. They must take a stand, reach out, make themselves uncomfortable if need be, step out on the limb and change lives. Actually, save lives.

RR—Well, that’s another possibility, yeah. You know the thing is, if this thing shows up—we’re talking about the hypnotic effect, that may be where the hypnotic effect comes from as well. It’s like it manifested into this reality. It somehow creates this energy displacement, but it may have a psychic component as well, and affect the mind. And it may be able to direct that.

. . . his obsession with all things dinosaur has taken on epic proportions. he calls them "dans" or, as of this week, "saurs". he finds one and yells "raaar!" he sleeps with a stuffed brontosaurus. he asks me to kiss his stuffed brontosaurus. he snuggles with "bont-o" every night. he only wants to read "sories" (stories) about "dans". he has memorized the words to our dinosaur books. watch out, here come the . . . "dan!", he'll shout. he know exactly who "rex" is. he likes to point to his sharp "teef" and then he points to my teeth and his own teeth and laughs. when you ask where his tail is, he points to his bottom and smiles and laughs. he only wants to watch "dan" (dino dan) on tv. he wants to wear his "dan. shooo-s." (dinosaur slippers boppy bought for him) all the time. morning, noon and even at bedtime. when he puts them on, he smiles and shouts "raaaaarrr!" i about melted into a puddle of sappy mama mush when i went to check on him last night and he was sound asleep, wearing his dino jammies, cuddling bronto and wearing his "dan. shooooes."

RM: The goal with this new album was to create a collection of really big pop songs that fit within the boundaries of the term “Wildlife Pop”. It’s not a concept album but it’s more of a complete musical idea as a whole compared to Ordinaire, which was ultramark and myself’s first effort at writing songs together and finding our comfort zones.
Logan traveled up to New Hampshire for Not Back to School Camp in September and drove for the first time instead of flying. He was accompanied by his girlfriend, Josie, and they camped and also stayed with friends along their route. Then a couple of weeks ago, he attended the ZTC Camp which was held in downtown Asheville. Brenna, as well as several friends, also particpated in the weekend event and we happily hosted a couple of the attendees who needed a place to stay before it began. From my perspective, ZTC Camp was a huge success and both my kids as well as some of the other young adults attending gave it glowing reviews.
In a referendum election, all Mr. Romney has to do is satisfy voters that he’s competent, advocates sensible remedies to the nation’s economic dilemma, and plans to stop Uncle Sam’s profligate spending and not raise taxes. Romney is well-suited to accomplish all three aims. Romney’s character hasn’t been an issue through a grueling intraparty vetting; it shouldn’t be one in the General Election, despite anticipated efforts by Mr. Obama’s team and the left to do so.
Still, he wasn't here to get any of those things, and walked across until he found a side room where he kept all of his clothes and smaller valuables. He was a fan of travelling light so only opened up just one bag and filled it with what he could before changing. He left the clothes Geoff had given him behind, yet another memento. He put on a black shirt, found himself a nice pair of jeans to wear and pulled his boots on. Tucking his jeans into his boots he decided to grab an extra coat just to be safe. Grabbing the bag and holding it behind him over his shoulder he grabbed a spare key for his box and the last of his spare money to fill it with before heading back out into the main room. Seeing as he had already told Geoff he'd be gone until tomorrow he decided to spend the night in the vault. It had been some time since he had been here after all. He laid down on a couch in front of one of the TV's and decided to watch it until he fell asleep.
I found this song last night, when I was assembling a CD for my kid´s piano teacher. She´s an awesome lady in her 50´s, and we often meet, and when we meet, we can never stop talking. I made her a CD with all my heroes, and it was nice sitting here, after everyone was in bed, listening through my collection and going through the mental images related with the music. This song was given to me by one of our Couchsurfers, Haleigh, and I had never consciously listened to it, between all the Mumford and Sons and Regina Spektor music. Last night, I did. And I really liked it.
Painting the highboy a glossy yellow was the best decision I made in the room. It is definitely my favorite piece. I know my grandparents would love that their dresser found its way to her room, and with such a fun impact.
I was going over my blog when she was here a few weeks ago. She saw my picture and said "that picture doesn't look like you". I knew what she meant, my hair is starting to get longer. I was thinking to myself - it was just taken a few months ago - well maybe more than a few. It really can't be that old.....
First “A Girl You Should Date” is actually a response to an essay by Charles Warnke entitled “You Should Date An Illiterate Girl” (This is the link to the original essay) And while they’re vastly different in tone and, partially, context…I’m pretty sure they’re both very much about loving a girl who reads…Only I think Mr. Warnke got dumped…So we shall forgive him and his hater-attitude. I think within his final paragraphs you’ll find the same gist Urquico has in her entire essay. Except Ms. Urquico’s will leave all bookish-women feeling warm and fuzzy and Mr. Warnke still comes off a bit burned.
I'm thrilled about the series, but what's making me most excited at the moment is rediscovering AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics - subjects that have lain dormant in my brain for several years. Way back... too many years to count... I did an MSc at Edinburgh University in Artificial Intelligence and fell in love with the subject, which surprised me by focusing more on the way humans do things like learning, understanding, language processing, vision, etc, than on the machines. Or maybe that was the aspect I paid most attention to. I soon became sidelined into linguistic semantics and ended up doing a PhD on the subject of 'then'. Honestly. I knew more about 'then', for a while, than most other people on earth. I can see you're impressed (or possibly not...). I do still feel a little glow, however, every time I use the word.

He asked another pathologist whom he works with to take a look at everything and make another report. He also ordered an MRI to be done which we did this morning followed by a visit with this new doctor. The MRI showed that the tumor has not gone into nor did it come from the bone which was a major worry but it appears to just be in the soft tissue. He does however feel that there is about a 1 in 10 chance that it could be malignant. One in ten doesn't really seem like that much most of the time but I think it is sort of like babies. They look so small until you are pregnant and you realize that one of those has to come out of you. Then they look humongous. When I am taking a risk with my kid 1 in 10 sounds so much higher. Maybe it is just me.
SPRITE SEASON BEGINS: The first sprites of summer are starting to appear in the skies of North America. The strange thing is, summer is almost three months away. “Sprite season is beginning early this year,” says Thomas Ashcraft, who photographed these specimens on March 30th from his observatory in New Mexico:

Is accomplishing the Father’s will as high on your priority list as making sure that you don’t starve today? Do you place more emphasis on working for Christ than climbing the corporate ladder, watching the football game, or saving money for a vacation? Or, is “going to church” on Sundays the full extent of your current service?
And it was pretty easy! My main problem was lack of moisture and too much heat. Before learning the tricks of the trade I was just washing my hair, conditioning for a few minutes and then frying it. Which is fine if you want to be bald eventually. But if you don’t more care is needed.
Are more people actually involved in these activities than ever before? Or are we simply exposed to more of what they’re doing, because their activities are discoverable online?

From this that He gave them, nothing more than bread and fish, and that He set this equally before all, He taught them moderation, frugality, and that charity by which they should have all things in common. This He also taught them in the place, in making them sit down upon the grass; for He sought not to feed the body only, but to instruct the mind.
I giggled, with coffee dripping from my nose and my chin, because the look in his eyes as he realized what his body had done, apparently without the approval of his brain, was priceless!
I guess some ask, why the criticism? After all, Jesus was not a man who did a lot of intimidation to those He met. He was humble, kind, and compassionate. He was the perfect Christian, duh, and yet He got slammed by those who did not understand Him or like Him. I hear many Christians today saying that the church does not resemble Jesus very much and that is why we are criticized. I will be the first to agree that the church has gotten off track in being what Christ wanted us to be. But, there aren’t any perfect people, even Christians, so that should not be a surprise. But what about someone like Tim Tebow. What has he done that is so un-Christ like? Kneel and give God glory in public? Help little children who are needy? And yet he still gets blasted at every turn.

I also have recorded last night's newest Downton Abbey and can't wait to sit with a cup of coffee and find out what is going on in post WWI English manor life.
I started with RIN: DAUGHTERS OF MNEMOSYNE because Netflix kept recommending it, because it had solid reviews, and because it was only 6 episodes long. Look, I tried once upon a time to watch Robotech and I couldn’t make it through four episodes, let alone 75. I’m not going to commit to something long-form at the start. Let me get comfortable in the kiddie pool before we go deep sea diving together, okay?
And here's the personal connection, which has stalled me for two weeks. In my own reviews of the Seattle Rep this season I found myself coming back to the nature of truth, and the trustworthiness of those on standing on the boards.Humor Abuse was a one-man memoir. How to Write a New Book for the Bible goes into detail on what happened and what didn't - what was memory and what was nudged one step closer to believability by quoting from the author's diary. I Am My Own Wife deals with the question of an unreliable narrator, yet leaves the audience curiously beached. Red featured real-world painter Rothko doing real-world Rothko things and saying real-world Rothko quotes, but is a construct, the pacing and lines shaped for the purposes of presentation.
It seems the children who grew up with “tough teeth” thanks to Mrs Marsh and her liquid and chalk demonstrations in the ’70s and ’80s are neglecting their own children’s teeth. Children are brushing less regularly, not visiting the dentist as often and consuming more sugary drinks than water.
Mr Morris said he often shakes his car mats outside, but will be more careful in future and wanted to warn others to do the same. "I don't want the same thing to happen to anyone else," he said.

The view from char minar was certainly a delight. The staircase to get up however was too narrow and steep. I guess architects forgot about people climbing up. Usual to the Indian standards the site was riddled with piques of paan (The banner of “Kindly Paint me red“ was the only sign missing, rest of the job was done fully well by the local tourist armed with their gutkas. This is specifically the case of staircase).

Most babies seem to love banana, and Jacob did, although he’s become a little more banana-averse as a toddler. Two cons are that they’re messy in tiny hands and they can also be constipating; I find half a medium banana a day is about Jacob’s limit.

I hope everyone had a wonderful Easter! We certainly did! Although it was my weekend to work (Saturday night), I think it helped us focus to get things done. We thoroughly enjoyed all of Triduum, making it to Mass on Holy Thursday, then Good Friday Services and Mass on Easter Sunday. Lots of time spent with family, as well as being able to watch my godson take the gifts up to Pope Benedict at Easter Sunday Mass in Rome. I just really felt so blessed this weekend.

To add insult to injury, (and what does that mean in this context?), we went out to dinner again tonight. We ate at the Fairmont Princess La Hacienda. And, just like last night, I ate more than I needed to. More than I should have. Oh, woe is me. The food was very good. We had guacamole, chips, and shrimp ceviche to start. Then I had wonderful crab enchiladas with yummy black beans and rice. And, oh yeah, here comes the dessert! Cinnamon churros with three perfectly scrumptious and fat-laden dipping sauces. The only good thing is that Gary shared the dessert this time. Oh, I forgot to mention the two Margaritas I had--no calories there, right? You know, some people actually don't figure in the calories from alcohol. But they are there, believe me. And they are empty calories.
What do you do when your "look" is perceived to be a hindrance and closes of access..There are Black and White cases (no pun intended) as in the case of Trayvon Martin ... but what if you could not get served, or were refused entry into a club based on your "look". What if t were your skin color; Your sexuality.

I thought, yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and then forgot about it in about a week, but God reminded me of it during the seminar about living in suburbia. And I had an idea… we usually have an inter-fellowship night at the beginning of the year to welcome new freshman, what if we had a second inter-fellowship night focused around the stewardship of our resources? If the Christian students at UCI were all receiving the same teaching, imagine what they could do together? Imagine what kind of witness they could offer the city by collectively stewarding their resources well as students yes, but then as graduates with jobs. Now, I am not naïve enough to think that this will all happen in the next year, but it has been on my heart for sure, and for now, its in the casting vision and seeking partners phase. That being said, as a personal thing, I have also been asking God, if this is an idea from you does that mean I am being called to stay at UCI, at least for the next few years?
Penstemon pseudospectabilis..strict warnings relative to over watering accompanied the instructions here, and the common name 'desert beardtongue' sealed the deal. I put it in a large clay pot with a couple of trailing Sedums and a Dudleya caespitosa. The presence of the succulents should deter me from the temptations of watering.

_____I hate discrimination. That's why I hate everyone equally. (funny discrimination quote)
True. I don’t want to do drama anymore, the drama everyone seems so willing to do. The mind stuff. The asking of the questions. The pointless ups and downs. That’s when I know it’s not meant to be. But still I dwell in it. And then…then comes that moment of crystal clarity, where you see the truth in all nakedness. The moment you realise it was a figment of your imagination. The moment you very easily let go,:)

No city aspires to be the “other” city. Especially, a city that offers so much. In the case of Vancouver, Washington, both the city and state are often referred to as the “other.” Vancouver is confused with its much larger metropolitan counterpart about 300 miles north in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state is often confused with the center of U.S. government nearly 3,000 miles across the country.

I think the process of making low relief tiles in volume from a mold would really be a great set of skills for an upper level high school art class...Basically, you make a sandwich of 3 (ish) layers of clay : cutting into the clay exposing the lower layers to create a relief design. Then you pour a plaster mold around it and pull the sandwich o'clay out reusing the mold for as many clay tiles as you care to pop out! I didn't exactly follow the format of the layers, instead I did more carving. Amy recommended the book Handmade Tiles by Frank Georgini for detailed information on the process.

William had been married six times in twelve years, and had more children than he could shake a stick at. He had an overwhelming love affair with onions. They called him the onionater. He would eat onions like everyone else eats an apple. In the mornings, he would stop by Dairy Queen to pick up some of their famous breakfast gravy and biscuits. When he arrived at the P.D. it was an event. The other officers were always anticipating the unusual breakfast of the day. William would prepare for his meal by pulling an onion out of his pocket and cutting it up into the gravy. He kept a jar of pickles in the fridge in his office. He would pour himself a small cup of pickle juice and add one pickle into his gravy. He was a great diet tool for the dispatchers and the other officers. The man has a sick sack of taste buds. Everyone in the station wondered if he even had any taste buds. William would then proceed to put anything on the table on top of his gravy and biscuits. Packets of condiments were always added to the mixture. It didn’t matter what it was, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard. Those watching would gag as William smacked his lips around his delicious breakfast.
This does seem like I’m simply trying to find a religion in which to convert to so I can become a board-certified chaplain one day, but I view this more as furthering my journey along my path for the search of my own truth. I am able to watch myself discern possibilities and new discoveries, and I am examing current beliefs as well as forming new ones, or simply exploring in my case of unsureness.

Publishers can also learn from what some non-publishers are doing. We have a member of staff currently going through the Edinburgh Business School MBA.

The Centre for Entrepreneurship Education and Development (CEED) has been changing the entrepreneurial landscape of Nova Scotia since its inception more than 20 years ago. The lives of thousands of Nova Scotians have been positively impacted through CEED’s multifaceted mandate, from small business training and financing to entrepreneurially-based interventions for priority youth in conflict with the law, as well as in experiential in-class workshops for Nova Scotia public school students. Recognizing the need for increased community engagement with respects to Social Enterprises, CEED has collaborated with a diverse suite of partners, such as Mount Saint Vincent University Business Department and the Norman Newman Centre for Entrepreneurship at Dalhousie University, to develop Social Enterprise for a Day (SE4D).

This is why I am planning to take another Writer’s Retreat. Last time the projects were to finish the short story With Honor and start Dragon. This time, I’m getting the second draft of Dragon finished. For those of you who are unfamiliar or forgot, my writer’s retreats are actual retreats – I go into the woods camping by myself and spend a couple of days reading, hiking, and (most of all) writing. No people, no pets, no chores, just me, nature, and my writing.
When you look back on your past relationships, very few (if any) ended the way they began. Somewhere along the line, “love” became hate. People who used to creep each other’s facebooks every twenty minutes to see what their true love was up to, eventually delete each other because they can’t stand seeing the other’s status updates in their newsfeed.

Apart from the militia entrusted with the maintenance of public order, the Soviet State keeps up a political and criminal police (the Opgu), and a permanent army. The Ogpu has the right of life and death over all citizens; it has the power to prosecute, arrest, and imprison any individual of whom the Secretariat of the Party wishes to be rid; it may judge him without witnesses, condemn him without proof, sentence him to lifelong exile, and banish him for ever from the face of the earth. There is no other example in bourgeois society of a police system with such extensive and complete authority; it might be termed the most “perfect” inquisitorial organization in the world’s history. At its command there is a close network of public and secret agents, paid officials, and willing informers, together with certain military forces which are directly under its orders and tactfully termed “special duty” or “vone” detachments. Its actual budget is unknown as it is maintained to a great extent with grants from secret funds, but in 1926 these were admitted to amount to 27,122,778 rubles (£904,000), besides 36,825,000 rubles (£1,227,500), which was the cost of the special military detachments (The “Finansovaya Gazette“, May 9th 1926). The Ogpu may, in the majority of cases, utilize as auxiliary agents all Communists and Comsomols, Soviet officials, the militia, and non-Communist members, as well as thousands and tens of thousands of factory, Trades Union, co-operative, and housing committees: they are all subdued by its all-powerful hand. In he towns, half the population spies on and informs against the other half. The Ogpu gives no account of its actions to anyone. In principle, it is only responsible to the the Council of People’s Commissaries, one of whom holds the office of Commissary of Justice. But as this Council, together with the executive body of the Ogpu, is nominated by the Secretariat, the latter serves as a cover for all the operation of the police by automatically giving them its approval through the Political Bureau. In other words, the Ogpu is not responsible to any authority but its own. By its orders, prisons, detention camps, and deportation centers are filled to overflowing with workmen, Communists, Socialists, Trades Union members, free-thinkers, Zionists, and even Tolstoyans—thousands of them all sentenced without any semblance of a trial.
Of course this all depends on what format my library has a specific book available in. From comparing what I bought in the last few months to what is available there are 4 books I purchased that could have been just borrowed. Plus there are a few I was not really sure if I wanted to read or not (Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) that now I can borrow happily.
I don't know what you make of this image, but I'm seriously smitten. It's not too fancy, but has a crumpled hobo feel to it, the sort that i like.
These are the 2 projects we completed this weekend for our Halloween stamp class. The "wicked" accordion tag banner design was altered for Halloween from the original Christmas design by Sharon Johnson from the Just Rite Stampers blog. We also made some treat packages using my new favorite Big Shot die "Candy Wrapper". I know this die is going to get a lot of use for all the holidays and when I entertain at home. I used Wicked Fun DSP for this project and can't believe how much paper is contained in the packages. I bought 2 packages of the DSP and I was able to do a workshop for 15, a class for 11 and still have a bunch of paper left over . What a WICKED value!

"Once elected, those presidents curbed the id with the ego, common sense and reason. But now the G.O.P.’s id is unbridled. The horse has thrown the rider; the dark forces are bubbling. Moderates, women, gays, Hispanics and blacks — even the president — are being hunted in this most dangerous game."

"...A candidate for public office in any contemporary democracy may have to consider what, if anything, to do about "global warming."

It’s rare that I bake a cake. Apart from the fact that my baking acutraments leave something to be desired, 2 out of 3 of us in residence aren’t that fussed about cake. Having said that, a birthday is not complete without one & so around this time every year I root out my hand-me-down rusty cake tins & set about making birthday cakes.
Not surprisingly, I approached it exactly like an academic paper. We were asked to blog about TV episodes, and I took it very literally. I actually took notes during the episode to keep track of characters and every plot twist. I wrote about three drafts before I was satisfied, but still had no idea if it was anything remotely close to a blog (of which I had read about 3). But it was not as difficult as I expected it to be, and I realized that I could relax my writing and do without the 3 revisions (which was good, because after the first week, I didn’t have time for that anyway!).

Or a prospect says he needs to shop for the lowest price. When the salesperson empathizes with this one because he understands his prospect’s reasons for wanting the lowest price, he will be more likely to sell at the lowest margins and lose business to the competition because of price.

I planned to start out with a simple, healthy soup. Whereas, my bitter half claimed that most soups are inedible, unless there's a pound of salt pork swimming in it.
In the fields at dusk we watched the Mad March Hares playing (before returning home for tea with Alice and the dormouse no doubt). Bounding through the sprouting wheat and barley, pausing occasionally to box each other before carrying on their whimsical game of tag. Roe deer spotted in the distance, only as tall as the hedges around them, slim elegant legs and necks, they walk sedately though the fields. Admittedly at this point I only saw the farm, I didn’t do any work or get involved in any way. But watching the wildlife at dusk you see how nature endures calmly and happily, barely disturbing the silence and flattered by the twilight, providing gentle entertainment, amusement and wonderment. I’m sure Mother Nature will reveal her nasty side to me soon enough – and eyes peeled because I’ll write about it when she does – but for now, I’m smitten.
Why do a reality show?
My husband put the shelves together while I pulled all of the bins out of the closet to get them ready for their new homes. I reorganized a few of them and pulled out some of the other items what would fit well on the shelves. I know that my kids play with their things more when they are easily accessible, so I'm okay with having their things out. I just want them to look neat and be easy for them to clean up.

I really enjoyed Texeira's artwork on this one. He has a very cinematic style and he's not afraid to draw large crowds of people and the folks that he presents do each have their own stylings (facial scars, clothes, hairstyles). When I first read this I was a little miffed at how quickly Jonah took to navigating a motorcycle, but now I see that there is some wobbling depicted in the artwork. I did like that Jonah is having to re-learn who/what is right and wrong in this new world and through no fault of his own he threw in with the wrong bunch.

It is a long process but I did this during the day, while carrying out my regular errands. I just put a hat on my head and went on with my business. When I woke up the next day my hair was soft and fluffy. I was very impressed. When preparing for bed I twisted my hair in big sections, sometimes applying shea butter. I did not use the Shea butter every night because I did not want my hair to be oily. And as you can see from the steps above, I used quite a lot of oil! On day 3, the top section of my hair, which has a looser curl pattern was getting frizzy so that night I lightly misted it with my conditioner/water mix, and sealed it with some olive oil and twisted it in smaller sections compared to the rest of my hair. That helped and produced the results you can see in the picture I provided. I did not do it on the 4th night because I was tired and the next day had very frizzy hair. But it was good. By the end of the week my hair was still happy. No dryness and no single strand knots formed. I was very happy.

I intended on giving a blow by blow account, in order to possibly help out someone who may find this post down the road if they are in a similar situation. But, I just really am feeling empty and tired. I took some photos, which I'll share, but I can't bring myself to write all the details out. Let me try to sum it up in a sentence .... Since Monday morning, there have been fans and dehumidifiers in the bathroom, Tucker's room and basement, attempting to dry out the now exposed plywood in the bedroom, hallway and garage below. Dang it, I need another sentence. One more.... Most or all of the first floor carpeting will have to be replaced, as well as a good deal of insulation that was ruined in the garage basement ceiling (directly under the leaky toilet). Insurance company has been great, as has my contractor. For the most part.

Believe it or not, Eurovision has been waving flags and invading living rooms since 1956 – that’s 56 years of glitter and Lycra and they have been glorious. Amongst this huge mess of forced smiles and block voting there have occasionally been very worthy winners, going some distance to restoring the faith in the collective European mass. Here are a few of the songs that, for varying reasons, more than deserved their spot at the top of the podium.

We get to the train station and no one’s there. Yet somehow, I refuse to believe we’ve gotten had. Through the grace of God Scott learns we’re at the wrong train station—apparently there are A and B stations with the same name. Our train leaves in 15 minutes but the taxi driver we find says we’re close. It doesn’t seem close enough. The traffic here is as maddening as it is confusing.

I have enough knowledge about the anime industry to say that the writers really planned out this episode well within the context of the rest of the series. I’m not caught up with the untranslated editions of the novel, so I can’t make any comment about how the characters are supposed to turn out, but I can say with confidence that the anime does its job as an adaptation, transferring the story into another medium with a reasonable amount of success. The original light novel’s author really comes out in the dialogue, particularly because the main character’s numerous internal monologues come straight from the prose. Either way, the story-lover in me was treated to something really nice and juicy this week, and I can’t wait to write the post for next week’s episode.

Spoon out about 1/3 cup of dough for each shortcake onto the baking sheet, leaving about 3 inches of space between the mounds. Pat each mound down until it is between 3/4 and 1 inch high. (The shortcakes can be made to this point and frozen on the baking sheet, then wrapped airtight and kept in the freezer for up to 2 months. Bake without defrosting – just add at least 5 more minutes to the oven time.)
However twitter has lots of other people on it that often say interesting things. Note I say interesting and not intelligent, thought through or even correct. From people exposing footballers that sleep with their sister in law, to people moaning about phone hacking journalists or even low grade big brother celebs having public slanging matches with other even lower grade big brother celebs, all of human life is as they say here. It can be a fascinating thing to tune in or out of.

The three loads nicely stack into a good comparison of reduced recoil loads vs. standard, and the 3" magnum shells add a 'spice' to the mix.

Aww shit! Torture me why don’t you! LOL. Ugh. Questions like this are really tough for me but here goes. I’m gonna kill Sisko because (and only because!) he’s sort of in weird Prophet limbo-land anyways and that makes it mighty convenient for me. I’m most attracted physically to Picard and if I have to wake up next to one of them everyday (uhh, yes please) I guess it would be him. Kirk’s a total manwhore but the flip side of that is he’s gotta know all kinds of crazy awesome tricks, right? So as long as he’s cleared by medical I’ll bang Kirk.
So it is permissible to sacrifice the male or female sheep or goat, and this is best. As for sacrificing other animals then the scholars have differed over this.

Back when I started my path into photography I would regularly practice with my cousin who would help me out and patiently model for me. But there was something just not quite right. I would reflect on the sessions and in all honesty the shoot would be quiet, not a lot of communication between us, long pauses whilst I was working out my settings, and a general stiffness in the small amount of useable images I would come out with.

SAINT ETIENNE – CARNT SLEEP (BETA)
I still wanted to have our conversation to talk about some rules, punishments, or at least a plan, but life got in the way last night. We did have some fun texting each other on the couch while the kids watched tv. He text me that he wants to clamp my nipples and put his dick in my ass. But I don't want him to ask - I want him to tell me to get the clamps and bend over...
However, on a typical trip, if I forget something major it’s just an awesome excuse to go shopping! But I am traveling to my first marathon here. I need my “Tried-and-True, Nothing New” stuff with me!! I need MY STUFF not new stuff. There are also a lot of variables in play here that make packing tricky. What if it rains? Should I wear a baseball cap or a headband? How hot will it be? Tank Top or Technical Tee? What if my feet are in bad shape after the race? What if I just can’t face the thought of wearing pants? (Don’t laugh! I often feel this way after extended bouts of exercise) Will I look ridiculous if I bring my cow girl hat?? (Answer… Don’t care, it’s coming with me). Anyways, I thought I’d share my packing plan and some tips for traveling to an out of town race.
The weekend is now in sight, so I hope you have fun whatever you're doing.

To narrow the wood, which is called "resawing," I put the fence at over 1/2", probably about 9/16" (just under 5/8") and start with a cut about 1" high.
Sidebar: For Secret Sun purposes Exeter, NH is important in that one of the most puzzling UFO flaps in the 1960s occurred there, inspiring the bestselling book Incident at Exeter. Phillips Academy Exeter is also there, the sister school to the more well-known Phillips Academy Andover over the border, the school of choice for the plutocratic elite.
But i have found a blog that has helped me focus on one small organization and one couple and one clinic and that has helped me - given me knowledge, yet held off the nightmares.
So, when the sun comes out, enjoy (don’t get burnt), and think of me. Knitting sweaters.

The atrium at our new church is not small. It was a good 50 running steps from our brunch to the beginning of the preschool wing. Heels are not meant for running ... and while I'm at it, I should tell you my undergarments were not either.

A very special thank you to all of the heroes who are collectively the United States Armed Forces, and their families. We owe you for our maintained peace, order, and freedom. Where so much more is deserved, we offer a warm and sincere "Thank You". Thank you also Monique and Alexa Peters for contributing this wonderful little story, and thank you Melissa Peterson, for helping Alexa breathe life into the pages.
I knew if I laid there long enough, the grass would grow until it came within My reach. All I would need was patience, and it could all be mine. After waiting a full five minutes, I decided that patience wasn’t working, and I retired to My Indoor Domain and the waiting food bowl. Unlike the grass, the food bowl never mocks Me.
But it is only logical to assume that a payment was in fact made. There would have been no incentive for Ansar Dine to release the woman otherwise. Moreover, Islamic law permits the collection of ransoms after abducting non-Muslims—a precept with which Ansar Dine is certainly familiar. Ansar Dine probably has a little more spending money today than it had prior to the Stockly affair.
I took Trout with me up to Chattanooga last Saturday to check out the market they have set up along the Tennessee River to see if I want to participate. I don't. Its way too hard. I was a little worried about taking Trout because she doesn't like little children - and by that i mean three feet tall or less - and she can also get aggressive towards other dogs when she is on a leash. V and I decided to split the dogs up for a while because their pack behavior was bad on Halloween night -they rushed the door anytime someone knocked and we couldnt make them get off or sit or do anything. So I took Trout and he kept Koby and we are working on having them stay seated when the door opens and waiting for a command to go through the door.
Bristol’s bid was submitted on Friday and now there is an online campaign growing to gather support. The city is up against competition across the world, including Hong Kong and Surakarta. Rival bids closer to home are London and Naples, Italy. Bristol recently welcomed Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, and also hosts the annual Festival of Ideas which attracts known writers and thinkers. Bristol’s bid promises that if successful, it will:

You should print an apology in your paper acknowledging that this cartoon was ignorant, offensive and racist and should not have been printed.
Got a feeling this Walker book may now be out of print but it is definitely worth hunting down in your local second hand bookshops.The illustrations are stunning.
You can add other questions but this will give you a start to determine the direction you want to go. You can still feel good about your decision instead of feeling resentful because you accepted this project because you felt like you were under pressure.
But assume I didn’t live in the forest any more, but in China. Some kind of fortune or misfortune has brought me there. Let’s assume that. Now that would be terribly unpleasant. For in China, as is well known, everyone is Chinese, even the emperor. I would stand out. My name is Hase, and I look like a German. One would be able to recognize me immediately. Why, even the children would stand stock still in the street and call out “That’s Hase.”
Well, guess what? The drug I used to think made me sleepy now keeps me awake. I fell asleep, I woke up. I sniffed for a while, fell back asleep, woke up again. Sniffed, etc. All the way through the night.
First, please take a moment to retrieve your precious, life-altering, want-to-marry-it, are-so-in-love-with-it-you-have-named-it iPhone from the toilet water and then frantically try to turn it on. Seriously, press the power button eleventy-thousand times in a row. Follow this closely by hitting the home button while simultaneously screaming, preferably LOUDLY, "FUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKK" in the work bathroom so that your co-workers think that you yourself have fallen in. Because this will not at all make your phone fizz from the headphone jack. Or cause it to blink rapidly through multiple screens, and then go blank, like it was having some sort of toilet-water-based seizure.

Don't know how many of you know, but Hubs was my first boyfriend, first kiss, first pretty much everything. (Yes, yes, I know... AWWWW.) So let me take you through a journey of us. Our own nerdy love story.
So, who was Ray Johnson? He called himself "the most famous unknown artist in America." But he was the founder of Pop Art, probably the first Pop artist. According to Henry Geldzahler, "Ray's collages, 'Elvis Presley No, 1' and 'James Dean' stand as the Plymouth Rock of the Pop movement (Geldzahler, Henry in Pop Art: 1955-1970 catalogue, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, 1986. Quoted in Wikipedia.)
I started thinking about how much I used to stress out about not doing things 'properly' or 'the right way', and how I used to get stuck in the middle of stories with no idea where to go next, a cold sweat broke out on my brow. I decided it might take more than one post to cover this sprawling topic in a useful way.
I have no idea what response to expect to this idea. I don't suppose I'll be inundated with people jumping up and down and saying 'Pick me!' but there might be more than one person who's interested. If this exchange of skills appeals to you, email me - info at debialper dot co dot uk - giving a bit of info about what you can do for me and what you would like in return.
Puree everything together and you have a persilade. Smell the green summer paste. Chances are you will want to have it just like that. Make slices all over the lamb/chicken/fish.Liberally salt the insides of the butterflied leg of lamb (or the thigh/ breast of the chicken OR all over the ribs OR the haddock cubes). Slap the insides of the butterflied leg of lamb (or the thigh/ breast of the chicken OR all over the ribs OR the haddock cubes)with the persilade. Wrap the meet like a sandwich. Just flip one side over the other. FOr ribs and fish of course you don't have to do this. Salt and persilade the upper surfaces of the meet sandwich.
The thesis that I came to as result of my inquiries is, I believe, of immense interest. It is that the world is going through a new period of change – a New Industrial Revolution – that will have immense ramifications. The opportunities for creating health, happiness and wealth creation from the new era will be spectacular. The social benefits and economic rewards from the emerging epoch will be shared not just by a few countries (as happened in the original Industrial Revolution) but by many.
we had already planned on going out to my parents that day anyway, so we left for their house after the vet. on the way out, my mom calls me and said she had called friends or ours wanted to bless us with a new puppy.
Saturday I got up early I wanted to see the Leopold Museum before heading to our opening at 11am (I am told this is not an unusual time for exhibition openings n Vienna). Being pressed for time I decided to just focus on looking at their Egon Schiele collection. I have always been a big fan of his work and I couldn’t let this chance to see so much of it pass me by. I was not disappointed his drawings have a fragile, intense beauty and I was happy to see his landscape/city paintings that were a complete surprise.
Our apologies for the mistakes!! We do our best, but sometimes small things like this can get past our testing process.
Asked whether she was OK with home-schoolers teaching children that homosexuality is a sin, she said: “Parents are allowed to educate their children in whatever model of school they would like to and if they have particular views with respect to a number of issues and choose to educate their children at home as a result of that, they are entitled to do that,” she said.
Firstly, I decided to switch my course starting next year to just Creative Writing. I have enjoyed Drama this year, but I really want to concentrate on my writing because that's where my heart truly lies. I've been accepted into all the modules that I asked for and I couldn't be more pleased!

I returned recently to the doctor after diagnosed pleurisy seemed to be refusing to go away. Conversation went like something this:
With women like Thatcher who worked so hard to make the inroads for us, why haven’t we gone farther? There are many reasons. One is that in many countries, even in North America, women still tend to take on more of the burden of household chores and childrearing. While men are becoming more involved in their children’s lives, the woman is usually the one in charge, taking the larger parental leave and making more time for sick days, etc. Think of the movie “The Descendants” when George Clooney’s character refers to himself as the “back-up parent”.

I've been writing about Compassion, recently. Feel free (again) to have a look at the websites and think about sponsoring a child yourself! I know of at least one other family that did so, after reading my previous post about Compassion. I'd love to hear from more people who are planning to! Or from people who already have a sponsor child!

He sits there and stares at me for awhile, and then starts talking again. He asks, All you want is for Jen to come back and talk to you? Ignore. Thats what you said in your blog right? Ignore. Well, Im here. You dont fucking count, I yell. He asked, Do you want me to call her and tell her to come over? I replied, no (but of course thats what I wanted, but I knew she wouldnt be able to, Matt was at work, and the girls were sleeping). Are you sure, he asked, I can go out in the living and she can come in here and talk to you. I plugged my ears, and he started crying. This pissed me off, when Im like this I really have no empathy, all I could think is that he was just going to sit there and cry instead of doing something to “fix this”.
Now I cannot write. Rather I draw letters and it takes a concentrated effort to do that. It also takes a concentrated effort during social interactions to carry on a conversation. No longer able to casually emphasize words with body language is constricting and distracting.

Then we have collection (which is our group time). We often start of singing songs together. Right now we are going over some USA basics about the states and Presidents. We're learning the "50 States That Rhyme" song. We've managed to memorize about half the states so far--and we point to each state as we sing it. It's been a fun challenge, though I doubt we'll ever sing all 50 states in 35 seconds like the young girl on you tube here!! I typed out the lyrics last summer. You can download them here if you're interested. We are also learning a few basic facts about the US Presidents. We've covered the first five and we'll eventually go up through at least Abraham Lincoln. Our main unit in history this semester is on the American West. I'll be posting about some of the things we've been doing with that soon.
A Place Under the Sun is a love song. Haroula Rose is offering her lover a refuge from the fears expressed in the previous two songs. The tenderness is something you can almost stir with a spoon here, and it is a beautiful thing. The music does something quite surprising. The song begins as a folk ballad, with the mood led by banjo and cello. Eventually, a piano joins the mix, but played with a light touch. The arrangement remains mostly acoustic, but the song becomes a rock song, a power ballad if you will. It’s a question of how the instruments are used, and it is never over the top. Actually, it really works beautifully. The arrangements on These Open Roads range from folk to rock, with even some Motown influences at times. Throughout, the lyrics are heartfelt, the vocals warm and emotional, and the arrangements endlessly creative.
Once the dough was ready, we died it with gel food coloring (not liquid - it would mess up the composition of the batter), and piped the cookies onto parchment. Then, you wait for a skin to form, like on pudding or pastry cream - about 10 or 15 minutes. And if it doesn't form? Something went wrong. Start again. Chef Briony told us if things aren't looking right, just start over - it'll save you time in the end instead of going through the whole process and have the final product be wrong. This actually happened when we were cooking - the Italian meringue was lumpy, and didn't look right, so we started fresh. Good thing we had extra 4-day-old egg whites!
The best lyrics I’ve ever heard, EVER! Foo Fighters are on a completely different level when it comes to making music. Every single one of their songs speak to you on a personal level, no matter who you are!

When I’m not in a rush to have the soup, I like to let it rest overnight in the fridge, skim off the fat in the morning, and add in fresh veggies so that there is something to chew (don’t get lazy, teeth!). Other than that, this is a pretty straight-forward recipe. Simple, delicious. What more could you ask for?
Intriguing. Particularly since it’s not obvious to me that the naming convention makes sense. Why would it make less or no sense to name a destroyer after a president and an aircraft carrier after a state?

I tried to spin the singles with a lot of twist, knowing that I would be plying with a lot of twist as well. In the past, while I got a pleasing single, when plied, I found them to be rather weak, and softly plied. But according to my spinning instructor, we were to aim for a "balanced yarn" which means that the twist in the single is balanced against the twist in the ply resulting in a truly relaxed stable complacent yarn. Well... okay.

On one occasion, I was standing in my kitchen having a seriously bad day not too long after Dominic was born and had finally came home from the hospital. I looked up to see a small dragonfly stuck to the screen of the window over our kitchen sink. It stayed there for a long time. I looked away, looked back and it was gone.
In the posted job description for the "Nestlé-Newark Now Family Nutritionist" there was no mention, at all, of breastfeeding. Nestlé spokesperson has said their “nutritionists” will be promoting and supporting breastfeeding (which is cheaper and healthier), but trust me, in reality, formula feeding will be the focal point of instruction. Nestlé “nutritionists” will say they are endorsing the use of home-made, whole, fresh foods for babies which are less expensive and more nourishing but in fact, they will promote Nestlé prepackaged, processed baby foods, first and foremost.
Later that day, it neared to my piano piece, until it was my performance! Ah! So, I just went to the stage and performed. No much mistakes! Until, it was the end of the show and we went home with some food to celebrate at home. =)
Most beer bloggers are passionate real ale advocates - it's just that we, like the public, judge a beer on how it's made and how it tastes rather than how it's served. And for that, Chairman Col et al think we are the enemy.

Mike Jones of the journal Revolutionary History stressed the importance of democratic demands in such a transitional program. He cited a comment of Arthur Rosenberg, a historian who belonged to the German Communist Party until 1927, that the party had failed, during the period following the German November revolution of 1918, to advance demands to oust reactionary holdovers from the state apparatus. This viewpoint was also advanced by British scholar Ben Lewis, who held that the ‘culmination of such democratic demands is workers’ rule.’ British historian John Rose countered that at least in the revolutionary showdown of 1923, German workers were more interested in workers’ power than in defending a democratic republic.

Above all, I need millions of people who buy my books. When that happens, I will continue to write and my stories will get better. My mythology of monsters will become roots of popular culture.
A level-headed person may or may not think that a statement issued which states that getting a young boy to take rather fearsome oath to prove his case against the paedophile priest Brendan Smyth….was to strengthen the position against Smyth…is a truthful recollection. It would perhaps be more convincing if the evidence gathered by the Cardinal (or as he would have it “notes taken by him”) had actually prevented Smyth from abusing children (world-wide!!!) for at least another decade.

But, I’m telling myself that it doesn’t matter that I couldn’t do everything this weekend. Maybe (probably!) on other weekends, it will matter. What makes this weekend special is the trip to the river, which is what most counted and what excuses everything else.
But you know, sometimes, something will slip by me. Something can sit in one place for so long, that it becomes part of the norm.
Next up: my new work ID. I walk around like this? Can you even tell that I'm in the picture or do I blend in completely with the background? Geez. I'm a ghost! Anddddd I look like I just rolled out of bed. I get to wear this around at work ALL THE TIME. And it's the picture that comes up when anyone in the company searches for me. I'm so glad people get to think I really look like that. At least my hair looks kinda good? Must get new picture ASAP!
A major selling point for the expansion has been the opportunities the wing brings to Madison and the university. It gives city residents new opportunities to experience art. Most obvious are the artworks themselves. The Chazen is currently the proud holder of pieces by 20th century figureheads like Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns and Pablo Picasso. Many of these are on lend from the private collections of Simona and Jerome Chazen (for whom the museum is named), so viewers should see them while they can.

The ARC seminar mentioned that all special education (and self contained classrooms) does for our kids is put them in "a very special room with very special people." And that only ends them (when they are over 22) in a "very special place with very special people" and as she said "those places aren't so nice." But today I think I like the idea of a very special place, where Kendall doesn't feel so different. And I don't feel so sad.
Marc turned out the lights, I remember how quiet it got. A contraction hit and Marc held my hand "Push, babe! You can do this" I started crying and saying "Nooooo, no, no, no..." Marc stayed calm and kept encouraging me through each contraction. At around 2:15 I cried to Marc "Im never going to have her! Whats wrong with me!" (Emotional signpost, anyone?) Marc went and explained to my Midwife what was happening and she told me to go and sit on my toilet and push. So I did, assisted by my sister Liz and Marc I waddled back and plopped down just in time for a contraction. I cried and cried, my midwife watched. This went on for awhile. My poor friend Lily called about the same time that I was pushing and yelling. She had just asked Marc how I was doing when she heard "UUUUGGGHHHHHHHAAAAARGGGHHHH" and said "I'll call back."

To my absolute joy, one of the first podcasts to pop up was The Ricky Gervais Show. I can't say everything produced by Gervais makes me fall over in laughter, sometimes his stuff can be really awful (I now make reference to that one off show Derek 'comedy-drama' on Channel 4 not so long ago). However, there are a few things from Gervais which are just pure brilliance - namely An Idiot Abroad starring Karl Pilkington. If you haven't seen An Idiot Abroad then you really are missing out on some fantastic television viewing.

The amazingness of a no-hitter in the MLB and the sweet victory and triumph of an NHL playoff win is a reminder that in today’s scandal filled world of sports, there is still the untouchable quality that makes sports what it really is today. While we are constantly faced with the harsh realities of a world in which bounty scandals, NCAA violations, and contract negotiations seem to take over, its the record breaking and hard work of the athletes that should be celebrated. The human interest stories about perseverance and determination is what really makes a sports fan love sports.
Ted sighed. He didn’t like kids, he liked them even less when he had to deal with them. It didn’t seem this one was going to go away.
It’s a self-perpetuating problem. Because media images are so pervasive and play such a huge role in how people learn how to define themselves and others, we tend to default in those definitions to what those images tell us. If the only examples of computer programmers a given girl sees are men, she’s going to assume that that profession is not for her, and self-select for something in which she does feel represented. Girls whose families make a point of telling them that they can have tech careers, or who are encouraged to be mavericks, and do something that a girl isn’t expected to do, may well buck that conditioning. But most are simply going to go with what their culture tells them about that profession and the people in it.

[N]euroimaging remains a crude technology, unable to meaningfully weigh in on assessments of guilt or innocence, especially on an individual basis. Imaging methods make use of highly processed blood flow signals, which cover tens of cubic millimetres of brain tissue. In a single cubic millimetre of brain tissue, there are some 100,000,000 synaptic connections between neurons. So modern neuroimaging is like asking an astronaut in the Space Shuttle to look out of the window and judge how America is doing. He can spot giant forest fires, or a plume of volcanic activity billowing from Mt. Rainier, or the consequences of broken New Orleans levies – but from his vantage he is unable to detect whether a crash of the stock market has led to widespread depression and suicide, whether racial tensions have sparked rioting, or whether the population is stricken with influenza.

After a peaceful hiatus at home in Rockabill, Jane True thinks that her worst problem is that she still throws like a girl - at least while throwing fireballs. Her peace of mind ends, however, when Anyan arrives one night with terrible news... news that will rock Jane's world to its very core. After demanding to help investigate a series of gruesome attacks on females - supernatural, halfling and human - Jane quickly finds herself forced to confront her darkest nightmares as well as her deepest desires. And she's not sure which she finds more frightening.

So many lovely words left for both Trev, for his family to read and to his sister and other family members, he was such a decent bloke, wouldn’t hurt a fly, didn’t drink, and would honk at me if I was walking or catching the bus in a morning.

Enough of that. Let us get into the story. In the first few scenes, we are introduced to three and a half minutes of Klingon ships flying in a straight line. They encounter a giant blue cloud. Being Klingons, they decide to destroy it, but it winds up destroying them instead. A nearby starbase is also destroyed by the cloud, but not before letting Starfleet know the blue cloud is heading for Earth.

If I can get everything in order, I will go back this fall, because if I’m serious about getting married, and actively meeting guys and getting myself out there, then it’s only a matter of time. Only a matter of time. It’s wise to get my education completed now – it looks like I have six semesters left – so that I will graduate around the same time I get married. I don’t want to put it off and end up doing it after the kids grow up. I would rather do it now, while it’s the most do-able.
So how can we do this all of the time, even while managing our external affairs? It is simple: we manage our external affairs by responding to them with wisdom and virtue. We listen to, contemplate and meditate on the Dharma specifically in terms of how it can be used and applied to the circumstances and challenges of our life, whatever they happen to be. We can do this not only in formal meditation, but as we go about our daily business. Wisdom and virtue is the correct response to every circumstance, both in terms of making us internally happy, but also in the sense of making all of our external activities successful. If we can do this all the time, every moment of our life will be happy, meaningful and bring us one step closer to the final goal.

It’s long past time that the American people wised up to the liberal demagogic attacks and understood that liberal policies hurt minorities, hurt women, hurt the young and hurt the poor FAR more than the conservative policies that liberals constantly demonize.
Here is how I've made my oatmeal even healthier. Quinoa has more protein than oatmeal and it gives my oatmeal a little more texture. I usually have red quinoa on hand which would give this a nuttier flavor which in oatmeal, would be good, but below I made it with regular blond quinoa. I also added coconut oil instead of butter because in Heidi Swanson's Super Natural Cooking, she says "coconut oil is rich in lauric acid, which facilitates brain functions and boosts the immune system." Sounds like the perfect thing for a winter morning. I've also added flax seed meal, because it's filled with omega 3 fatty acids.

I didn’t particularly know this man, but sure didn’t appreciate him coming in telling me this. I knew he worked closely with a particular boat broker and wondered if that broker hadn’t suggested he drop in on me to feel me out. I looked at him very calmly and told him people die all the time in their homes, doesn’t make the value of their home drop by half. I also told him I’d lost my husband – not my mind! At that point he could see I was agitated and left lol!

Gramm, an outspoken conservative who opposes the rules, last year managed to kill a similar bill that would have overhauled the community lending laws. The White House insisted that banks be required to have a strong track record in local loan-making as a condition for being allowed to expand into other financial activities.

But Fernandez pulled off a remarkable comeback on the back of a brisk economic expansion and an outpouring of public sympathy. She was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, promising to stay true to her policies despite objections from Wall Street and international investors.
I know these days of refreshed pain are important. Too often I keep myself busy to minimize the pain, and there is no effective way to get around true grieving but to feel the pain and go through it. Or so I’ve been told. Reconnecting with the pain is also a way of reconnecting to him. The faster I go through the grief process, the further I get from him. The farther I get from him.
In contrast, Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, welcomed the EU statement as “politically responsible.”

I pinched my fingers only once. I was working hard and sweating so much by the time I had broken it open, I had muddy sweat running into my eyes.
Maybe this head wants to be somewhere away from this demobilized body I suppose? Maybe this mind needs a divorce, a trial separation? My heart is starting to beat like a manic Indian drum!
I’d seen these before, long with other figures and vehicles. Playskool has a Star Wars license, and they’ve put together a pretty slick line of toys for the 3-6 range. As you can see, the Falcon opens up to make a playset, and there’s all sorts of little accessory doo-dads to snap into this bracket or plug into that connector. Stuff like the dish and the cannon pops off the outside and snaps into place on the inside. Everything seems designed for little, awkward hands in mind. Opening the ship too far doesn’ break it; it just pops off and you can pop it right back on. All the little pieces go inside when the kid’s done playing, you pop it closed, and it even has a little concealed carrying handle. The figures are rendered in that exaggerated/stylized manner that for some reason to me is just frikkin’ cool.
Regardless. Simply for such brilliant showmanship, for being so slick, so adaptable under pressure and so frighteningly intelligent, this entertainer was worth every penny of the ticket price.
Townsend: The Beatles were known as the Fab…?
archaic pop guddled by a new generation.
A large part of the Beatles’ allure is that, with each subsequent album, you could chart their development as songwriters, musicians, and human beings. It’s pretty difficult to do this with any other bands like, say, the Rolling Stones, who simply got older, or Led Zeppelin, who somehow got dumber with each release. In the same way, each episode of Avatar brings us closer to the characters and shows how they evolve as individuals throughout the course of the series, which almost never happens in a kids’ show. “The Earth King” simply doesn’t provide that sort of interest like previous episodes (even relatively lightweight ones like “The Chase”) did.
I am still trying to recover from the chills I had all over on Saturday night when I saw Les Miserables at the Fabulous Fox Theater. It was, in a word, INCREDIBLE! My parents gave me 2 tickets for Christmas and it was one of the best gifts I’ve ever received. I love musical theater, and Les Miserables is one of the most beautiful compilations of song in the world. In fact, I not only was covered in chills, but my heart was racing, it took my breath away, and tears filled my eyes several times. It is that good!
In the mid-19th century, the British obsession with Indian curries and culture really started to take off (see this post for a brief history of Britain’s love of spice and India). It wasn’t just the spiciness, but the romance of the place. Queen Victoria loved the country and even had an Indian wing in the palace. Although she was the Empress of India, she never actually visited the country, leaving all that excitement to her sons.

We went back in and I took a few moments to take a gander at Levon's shiny yet exactingly-worn drums. I was a drummer and singer, too, with my band UberEasy back in Atlanta. But I played just congas, bongos, and hand percussion. Wandering around Levon's high-ceilinged great room, I noticed sets of hand percussion that were labeled "Amy," whom I later discovered was Levon's only child. I took a moment to play these instruments, but I was careful not to disturb them too much. I looked back up at this house's amazing structure, with the rich smell of its wood in my nose, and decided I needed to join my friends.
There is also another way that we can misuse the Lord’s name. As Christians we are a representation of God Himself. What we do and say represents our opinion of God, and it can also affect the opinion of others about God as well. It was so important to God that we act righteously in His name that He made it a commandment!
Therefore, the Apostle emphasize very strongly in their warning about the end of the world that we must beware of deception. St. Paul says in II Thessalonians 2:9-11: “The coming of the lawless one, by the activity of Satan, will be with all power and sings and lying wonders… God shall send (that is, allow) a strong delusion, that men should believe a lie.” That is, it will be something very deceptive.

Maybe we think it is, still, after all this argument okay. Why? Surely the only reason must be some thinking along these lines: “criminals are all a bunch of paedo’s and murderers and should be given the death penalty anyway.” Once in prison you have been proven to be scum. Ignoring the many cases which are won on appeal, where the wrongly convicted come out of prison sometimes years, even decades after being sentenced, let’s just agree with this sentiment. Prisoners are scum. In which case, surely the last thing we want is to dehumanise them even more; to make them more bitter, more angry, more hopeless, even less able to cope with life, with even more hate for our police and our laws – in other words even more dangerous?

The sheer curtains on the picture window were hung too low, so I kept them off until I find a better choice. I also started painting the breakfast room chairs. And by started, I mean I painted one. How about we have all kinds of fun and back waaaaay up...here's the kitchen when we moved in. Warning: cover your watch because this room is so homely it could stop time.

Okay, so I've been gone since late September, and I feel like I should probably tell you all where I've been. First, I had school, which I already explained. I was officially a college graduate on December 15th. We went out for Chipotle burritos to celebrate. I thought I'd rest over the Christmas break, then hit writing head on in January, along with hitting the treadmill (I haven't been on a work out regiment since before I got married, and all that busy college food has not done good things).
The truth is... I 100% know I made the right decision, but I also know that I could have run and finished that marathon. But fortunately, I had my "big picture" hat on and knew that healing would take longer if I pounded through that discomfort. Plus, it helped, to be perfectly honest, that Big D, for me, was more about the 4 amazing women that would be taking on their first marathon. And this issue allowed me to be totally there for them instead of worried about my own race and issues... which, looking back, is exactly where I should have been - on the course, cheering.

In addition to requesting the gender, William also wanted to share this blog with the geneticist.

“Ummm... What just happened?” I ask, with marked confusion.
The set opened with the track ‘From Sidi Bouzid to Cairo” taken from the latest, more dubstep-heavy EP “Sidi Bouzid Syndrome”. SC Yosh’s opening move on live video installation was a split scene – the top half, which was a serene street scene, seen from bird’s eye view, persisted, whilst the bottom half jolted with clips of soldiers and protestors. Hot reds and scorched yellows flicked back and forth with black and white. The track itself, as the website explains, takes “recordings from the streets of Tunis and Cairo, international media, and pre-revolution propaganda material taken from a video meant to be an Ode to Leila Ben Ali, the Tunisian dictator’s wife”. It is with tracks like this that the band is adding an intelligent and overtly political face to a quality electronic sound.

The boys passed out as soon as they got in the car and slept all the way to our next stop - IKEA. A trip to Orlando isn't complete without a trip here. They weren't too happy when they woke up from their nap, but it quickly changed when they saw where they were and remembered they had a play area. Trevor had worked so hard and being potty trained so he could go play this time. Unfortunately they only one spot left so I didn't let either one of the boys go in - talk about disappointment. Now we had to shop pretty fast.
The car issue was not so easily remedied. After ruling out that the battery was in good working order, talented Daddy continued his diagnosis. Starter. No big deal. Okay, it was a big deal.

In 2002, Tom Peters (owner of Monk’s Cafe) had the opportunity, and the courage, to convince the Van Steenberge brewery to bottle its famous ‘BIOS – Vlaamse Bourgogne’ under private label for him. The Flemish Burgundy of the Van Steenberge brewery is an OLD BROWN in style, aged in oak, and is one of the oldest brews made by the brewery, at least brewed for over 300 years. Tom Peters knew the beer since long, but had always trouble to find some bottles, even in Belgium. Indeed, the beer is only brewed once a year. A final tasting of a whole line of Belgian Old Browns in the Brugs Beertje bar (Brugge) tilted the decision: this is the best Old brown ale in the world! And Tom went to the brewery to see Mr. Paul Van Steenberge and Mr. Jef Versele, the owners of the brewery.
So little time to post at present. My wife's chosen epitaph for me. "He just didn't have time". But now that the Six Nations is over I thought I'd choose my teams of the Tournament, and tomorrow's Lions team. I wasn't going to bother until I caught up with Paul Ackford's assessment in today's Telegraph. Just screwed the paper up and threw it in the fire. He's either blind or biased. Time for the management to give him something else to write about. How on earth can he leave the 'Player of the Tournament', Dan Lydiate out of either team. Its this sort of reporting that threatens the Union. Definitely makes me feel more Welsh - which may influence my selections.
How desperately I want the laser-like focus that is required to walk the narrow path in our loud culture.

Like any other holiday, a cluster of unique rituals has grown up around Halloween. They’re so common these days that we don’t even question them or how they came to be. We see a jack o’ lantern and it is instantly associated with Halloween. Same with wearing costumes, trick or treating, bobbing for apples, etc. But where did these rituals come from?
Thank you Lord for giving me a man who loves and follows after you, even when it's messy.

It is clearly a handicap, but I have more difficulty measuring my ability in many areas than some of my friends do. Then there are times when friends doubt but I don't. That usually concerns winning friends and influencing people.

The question has come up plenty of times regarding me becoming a therapist, but really? I’d be a god awful therapist. I can only do this because I don’t have to play therapist, I can say some really messed up shit and get away with it. Let me give you an example or two.

"The relative safety of ST and other smoke-free systems for delivering nicotine demolishes the claim that abstinence-only approaches to tobacco are rational public health campaigns...Applying harm reduction principles to public health policies on tobacco/nicotine is more than simply a rational and humane policy. It is more than a pragmatic response to a market that is, anyway, already in the process of undergoing significant changes. It has the potential to lead to one of the greatest public health breakthroughs in human history by fundamentally changing the forecast of a billion cigarette-caused deaths this century."

Basically everybody knows what to expect here that can be seen in plenty of other Nicholas Spark’s adaptations that have come out in recent years such as ‘Message in a Bottle’, ‘The Notebook’, ‘Dear John’, ‘The Last Song’, and plenty others. All of those (with the exception of one, I’ll let you guess which one) are very bad and pretty much the same exact thing. This is another one that can be added to that stupid list that needs to go away and go now!

Wednesday - Leftovers
Reading: Fifty Shades of Grey (shame face). I don't make a habit of reading romance novels because they are just so silly and over the top. But I admit that all the hype about this one made me curious - much like when I picked up Twilight many years ago (though in that case, I couldn't make it past the first chapter). This is not especially well written. It is repetitive. The female lead is annoying and predictable. In any case, I like to be in the know, especially in politics and pop culture. (What an odd pairing.) At least now I can have an informed opinion when the subject comes up. I hear a movie is already in the works - will be interesting to see who takes on those roles.

Second thing. I'm joining a gym. It's about 15 minutes from work, so it's a little farther away from the office than I'd like (it's going to make lunch time workouts a little harder to do, but still doable). It's also on my way home, so I will still be able to go, even if I end up working late. I really need to run/exercise or I get VERY squirrely, and it's really hard for me to get out and run during the winter. So gym it is!

Some homebrewers are concerned about their water useage. Brewing requires a fair amount of water, not only to mash and rinse the grains but also to chill the boiling wort before you add the yeast. Again, here on our farm I don't really waste anything. I use the very hot water that first comes out of the wort chiller to clean my equipment. Then, when it starts to cool off, I capture it in 5 gallon buckets and use it to fill the water troughs for the animals.
No one believed Noah. Of all who lived at the time, only the eight immediate members of his family followed him in this. God was going to send rain. It never had rained. What was that? There was going to be a universal flood. That also was strange to them. It never had happened, no not in the history of the world. To them it was foolishness.
I don’t know that it did. I had a writing group of people I’d met on the MA and we all worked quite closely together, workshopping each other’s work chapter by chapter as we had done the year before. It was a bit more scary though – I felt I couldn’t make a mess of the second book, as I already had the two-book deal.

By this point we’re all pretty much aware that Entourage hasn’t been great since season 3. It built up so much goodwill over the first three years that you kind of just stick around hoping it will get ‘Aquaman’ good again.

NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has “sniffed” molecular oxygen ions around Saturn’s icy moon Dione for the first time, confirming the presence of a very tenuous atmosphere. The oxygen ions are quite sparse – one for every 0.67 cubic inches of space (one for every 11 cubic centimeters of space) or about 2,550 per cubic foot (90,000 per cubic meter) – show that Dione has an extremely thin neutral atmosphere.

If you are a local performer the best way to get your face familiarized is to attend one of the shows you hope to be booked in. Stay for the show and approach the producer afterwards, introduce yourself and express your interest in performing there. Follow up with an email and send video clips and descriptions of your act (I will go into this in more detail later). When a performer introduces themselves to me in person, it helps solidify who they are to me in my mind among a sea of faceless emails and complicated burlesque names. It also helps me to know that the performer already knows what the venue and the venue's clientele are like, and more importantly, what type of acts are booked and what type of stage (or lack of) she will be dealing with.

Once they'd realised that my car was a mess and their lorry wasn't they offered to drive us into town and they very helpfully moved my car onto the grass verge at the side of the road.
Details of police monitoring used for the first time during the tournament were discussed at a privacy forum in Wellington yesterday, at which it was revealed that the average person is digitally recorded about a dozen times a day – and even more if they use email and social media frequently.
Same thing: he calls me when the date is over. This time he has noise on in the background so loud that I had to comment. It sounded like porn. “Is that porn?” “Yes. I can’t turn the volume down.” And continued his conversation. I tried to go with the flow. Shush don’t judge. But the screaming kept me very unfocused. Doesn’t bother to pause it or anything that might make sense. So, I simply say “Is she screaming?” Quiet, then in a very breathy voice says yes. Nice! “Are you jerking off?” In shorter breaths says “I’m thinking about your ass!” Then cums. I naturally hang up, not because I don’t like a little phone sex. I just like to know that I’m gonna be participating. He continued to call me all night long.

My first night sleeping in my guest house in Siem Reap was fine, for the first three hours. After that, jet lag set in and I was up looking at the clock every hour or so from then on. But I wasn't fussed. This was Friday night, the next day was Saturday and all I had to do was a bit of shopping and getting myself organised for the two weeks of workshops that are due to start on Sunday. But Saturday was all mine and I had promised myself that I could be as slothful as I wanted.

The degree to which this sincerity of itself is enough to establish the merit of Hogancamp's art could be a matter of debate. This is to suggest that it seems unlikely anyone could grasp it's profundity without having background information about the man's biography. It might be possible to uphold as a corollary of the art-for-art's-sake rule that any circumstances surrounding the art's creation should be disregarded. In the case of Hogancamp specifically, however, this corollary should itself be disregarded because in the first place it is beyond debate that he is not creating art for art's sake.

According to the “National Crime Prevention Council“, being a bully is shown to be a gateway behavior, giving them the impression and teaching them that threats and aggression are acceptable behaviors, even in adulthood.

I saw this recently and I just absolutely love it. It calls for you to go after all your dreams without fear. As we have grown up in a generation where the gap between formal schooling and settling down to start a family is only growing, we have had the time to ponder what our dreams really are. Heck, we have grown up in a generation where settling down doesn’t even have to be an option! Some would say we have more freedom to make our own choices than ever before. This freedom has given us the opportunity to ask ourselves questions that have come to be associated with the “quarter life crisis”:

I wish there was someone around here I could talk to that gets this. (Hope - if you're reading I don't mean to exclude you - pregnant people are hard to be around right now. I hope you understand, and I hope everything is going well for you). The friends I could call include 2 pregnant women, one of whom is unemployed (along with her husband) and purposely got pregnant with her third when the second isn't even two yet, a 37 year old virgin, a woman who couldn't be bothered to take the pill and has had several abortions, and my sister who has access to the best medical money can buy. You can see that I have trouble with resentment in pretty much all these cases. I realize I sound like a stuck up bitch but I know when something will cause more harm than good.
The result of these sustained, single-take musical performances by actual musicians — prime among them the recently deceased Dutch harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt, who plays Bach — is the way in which our concentration becomes sharpened and focused on the smallest details of music-making: its labors, its gestures, its accidents.

Jesus sent us to proclaim the gospel of the Kingdom in which God is glorified by the reign of Christ as Lord of one’s life, but we have resorted to proclaiming a gospel of salvation instead. Don’t think I am disparaging the simplicity of the gospel; I was saved by praying a sinner’s prayer in childlike faith. However, once people give intellectual assent to the premise of our presentation and sign on the dotted line, then it should not be an exercise in futility to persuade them to tithe, attend church, serve the Lord and live according to Christlike character.
In the inner circle of sibling relationships, what makes it more hurtful when they do something that you don't like is that it is way more than just a stranger calling you a name or doing something to hurt you:
And because Waste Land a film about all of this and more, it is a great film indeed. What begins as an interesting experiment, turning garbage into art, becomes a sociological study of the transformative power of art on people, and of people on the art and the artist. Waste Land shows us how people can be bound together through work and art, not only to each other, but also to their larger socio-political and historical legacy. It is a film about the ways humanity and beauty can be found, thrive even, in the most challenging and unlikely places, when people have the resolve, and the love, to make it so. Most importantly perhaps, is the fact that Waste Land is a real treasure, the sort of heartwarming and life affirming study of people, lacking in both sentimentality and cynicism, that uplifts the audience and elevates the art form.

Mercedes launched their 2012 car late, by missing out on the first test. It’s not clear if this delay was due to the need to repackage the car around the DRS duct, but clearly the Mercedes car needed some special adaptation to accommodate the car ducts along the car.

I was thinking about how many reality TV shows are on these days and have come to the conclusion there are more reality shows than regular shows. I was wondering what shows would appeal to the young adult audience. We have so many to choose from, Jersey Shore, American Idol, Punk’d, Khloe & Lamar, The Voice, only to mention a few reality shows; then we have regular television programs such as Glee, Smash, The Secret Circle, The Vampire Diaries, Gilmore Girls; and as always the usual “family” type shows such as Bones, House, NCIS, NCIS-LA, The Middle, Suburgatory, and Modern Family.
But let us turn with relief from the ridiculous to the sublime. I am very keen on books about crime, especially Italian ones. Italian crime has a sophistication and ingenuity all its own, and so does Leonardo Sciascia. His books are so good that she who governs my every step studied them at University.
One of our major pivot points happened soon after we had won the competition and we acquired a new contract with a school. Most of the previous inventory that we purchased had been ‘used’, and we were able to buy at a very discounted price. But for this new school and for growing at the rate we planned to, we knew that we had to get financing and restructure our procurement and growth processes a little bit. We needed the ability to purchase more expensive new units. Again, being part of Cupid’s Cup was very influential with this because of their partnership with BB&T. Through these connections, we were able to acquire a loan at a very low rate, and now have a solid business plan and financial model in place for any new school we happen to form an agreement with.
UPDATE 16 April 2010: Alt-Right's ongoing construction of a fictional Auster is Auster's lame reply to "ignorant and off-base statements about me". He complains that:Every time an article about me appears at Richard Spencer's website Alternative Right, which is not an infrequent event, it attributes to me, without evidence, without any quotations from my writings, views that I do not have and that I have never stated and that frequently are the opposite of my actual views. There have been so many such false attributions, particularly in Richard Spencer's long article, "Austercized" (which I only gave a careful reading recently, after Spencer's podcast interview of me), and in Richard Hoste's blog entries about me, and it would take so much work and time to reply to them all, and there are so many more pressing and more interesting things to write about, that I've put off replying to them so far, though I will try to get around to it.

I’ve had people tell me, “I don’t feel like saying nice things…” or “I just felt they needed a piece of my mind!” Well, I didn’t feel like getting up this morning- but I did. Why? I had responsibilities. My future as well as my current quality of life depended on me getting up and doing what I was committed to today. If we only do what we feel like doing we will never be successful. What about the morning we wake up and don’t feel married? Or better yet, what about when we don’t feel saved? The Bible teaches us that we MUST “walk by faith” and not by our feelings and emotional impulses. We have to choose to speak positive words because they are shaping and directing our lives.

Since “kill a host of demons” is the last line of the query and comes after a colon, it seems like you’re trying to give it weight. But we already know that Zell “ganks” the undead, so this is ineffective unless there is some type of characteristic the demons have that’s much stronger than those of other beings.

Some people wish to downplay the significance. I won't. Having needed my wife to stay by my side in a medical emergency--I surfed into a sailboat off the coast of New Jersey and was lucky to get away with bruises and a concussion--I understand how important it was that she was considered my spouse. The emergency room doctor in New Jersey almost chased her away because she didn't have our "kennel papers," as we call extra legal documents that we had to get like our medical powers of attorney, on her. We had to rely on the kindness of an understanding nurse. Our friend was terrified when his daughter got sick in school, he was far away, and his partner wasn't allowed to pick her up. They hadn't married yet. He therefore wasn't a legal guardian. They decided to get married that night. They were well aware that they couldn't always make that decision.

Thanks to a generous legacy from former patients of Chapel Allerton and a kind gesture from the Friends of Chapel Allerton Hospital, programmes are now being broadcast from a new purpose-built studio just next door to the old one. The old studio will continue to be used as a record library, as well as providing a working area for programme preparation and a guest waiting area.
In many discussions of this question that I've come across, I've also encountered a built-in, assumed, or implicit perception that a child with Ds is somehow a down-graded, or a challenged version of what he or she should be. That there is a certain kind of normal that, if it wasn't for the Down syndrome, that child would have a better chance for attaining. That Ds in itself is a challenge to be overcome. Something to be beaten on the road to normalcy.

Who doesn’t love Sherlock Holmes? Who doesn’t wish that he could have found a life-mate, other than Watson, who could match him, wit for wit? It may seem incredible, but Laurie R. King did this when she created Holmes’ protegee, Mary Russell. These books are delicious, and, like Jacqueline Winspear’s Maisie Dobbs’ series, have a feminist slant. Ms. Russell is not afraid to wear the pants, do the hard work, and even cut her long blond locks, should the case warrant it. With the added flavors of religion, languages and exotic locales, these new Holmes mysteries, took my breath away. I put away my constant yen for science fiction because of these mysteries. Now the first area of the bookstore I head for is the mystery section.

The rules vary from high school to high school, Uni to Uni and from State to State and even from pub to pub with paddles being used by some to hit the ball and some use quarters instead of balls. Why you’d want to play with coins that have quite conceivably found a recent home in a beggars’ bumcrack, I don’t know. I guess if you are using Bud for the beer, it may give the stuff some semblance of flavour.
ピザ自体とても美味しく、私にとってはジャカルタで味わったピザの中では一番美味しかったです。値段に関しては、外国人を対象としたレストランの中では、平均的で、高くない値段と感じました。立地条件もよく、ジャカルタの中心街に位置しているので、とてもアクセスしやすいと思います。Luna Negraは、デートや女友達との外食などにもとても合うレストランだと思います。ジャカルタのゴールデン・トライアングルと呼ばれるオフィス街に位置しているため、月曜日から金曜日はビジネス関係の昼食や夕食に来るお客が多いのではと思います。ビジネスミーティングや、家族の食事会などもできそうなガラスに囲まれた個室もありました。夫と私は6歳と3歳になる娘2人、友人も同じ位の年齢の子供を連れていましたが、とても居心地が良かったですよ。ジャカルタに来て嬉しいのは、皆さんとても子供好きで親切な事ですね。

But there is another side to their nostalgic backward glances, though they have managed to find some half-plausible cover for their designs — which are as ancient as early recorded history and as new as today’s front page. And that nostalgia is concerned with the eradication of the Jews. The Joos. The Zionist Entity. The swine and apes. The sub-human ones. Don’t kid yourself: rabid anti-Semitism is alive and well in the higher reaches of American society. It has always been there, but only lately has it learned to cloak itself as something else.
I even got a birthday surprise of 18 new tomato plants (18!!!), 6 zucchinni plants, and 12 pepper plants! So far I've worked 6 of the tomatoes in and gifted 2 of them to my mother, the non-gardener who is excited yet scared at the same time, rather like a mother with her first newborn. :) She doesn't know it, but I plan to make her have basil, too. (You can't have all those beautiful tomatoes and no basil to make my favorite summer margherita pasta). When I suggested this to her, she cringed and said she would kill it. I'm going to convince her otherwise.

I found a new family doctor this summer, a rarity in my city due to its population and the lack of available physicians. In my first interview, she takes a look at my plethora of symptoms and promptly asks if anyone has ever mentioned ‘Crest’. Confused about the relevance of toothpaste, I ask her to explain. Seems there’s an autoimmune disorder out there called Limited Scleroderma, or CREST syndrome (the acronym doles out the five core symptoms). We review them and I go home, shaking and realizing I have four of five. My respiratory health has taken a sharp decline without explanation; CREST can create blockages in the lungsm reducing capacity. Reflux? CREST causes that too, due to abnormalities in the body tissues. Spider veins? Check. Raynaud’s Phenomenon, an affliction of the hands and fingers where cold sends all circulation running away and leaves them white and icy, is a problem I’ve had since my teens. But it’s the joint issues, where CREST creates pressure due to abnormal collagen, that should have screamed out to someone I saw: multiple GPs, two rheumatologists, three physiotherapists, and a gastroentologist. New doctor retests me for that pesky antinuclear antibody: it comes up positive.

We stayed for a year and a half this time. We traveled, to Japan, to China, to Thailand, and we squeezed in as many weekend trips around Korea as we could. It crept up on me just how much it felt like home — as much as any place I've ever known. Korea is a country rich with culture and history. It's the smell of the sea and the buzz of a people who never stop moving. It's train rides through the countryside, passing concrete highrise after concrete highrise, which are plopped right in the middle of some of the greenest, most breathtakingly beautiful landscape you'll ever see. The culture is fascinating and at times infuriating. I loved it most of the time and hated it a little bit of the time. It's the only place I've ever gotten homesick for. Sharp, acute homesickness that comes and goes in waves. I think I'll always miss it.
I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.

The day after Victoria died, I took that bottle down from the shelf. I ran my fingers over the label and wrapped my fist around the bottle. I thought about the pain and hopelessness of loss, and about how good it would feel to just make it all go away for a little while. I took the cap in my grasp and started turning it. It moved just a little bit, and I felt the paper seal straining in my grip, almost ready to tear. My brain started telling me lies. "Go ahead," it said. "Just one drink will make you feel better." And I started to believe it.
Director Fukugawa commented, “I felt the theme and power in this song, and my worldview for video expanded. I materialized that and made a drama inspired by the song. I would be happy if those who watch it will like it.”
The bottom line is that the shadow can be three to four times as long as the actual object. All it takes is for the light to be at just the right angle. Low-aiming light gives a long shadow and makes for an illusion of size.

Do not get me wrong: I am proud of what I am doing and what I’m accomplishing; I am glad I am taking care of my life right now, and pushing myself forward on the right track. I will say, however, that my situation is just that: mine. I don’t judge anyone’s life, and I don’t want anyone judging mine. I know of the mistakes I made; I made them.

The parade also ended up being cancelled and a new parade called the Hollywood Santa Parade was initiated.
Toad in the hole has nothing at all to do with toads, thank goodness. It is a simple combination of sausages roasted in a pan, and then covered with a thick pancake- like batter and baked on a high heat until the pancake rises like mountains, and the sasages peek their heads out from the valleys. The batter is yorkshire pudding mixture – the famous accompaniment to roast beef which is a basic mixture of flour, egg and milk. There is always a lot of chat about the best way to make a yorkshire and in Yorkshire itself, there are proper competitions and everyone takes the thing extremely seriously. I think it is a glorified pancake. Other cultures have similar things. I even saw a recipe for ‘Artichokes in the hole’ in an Italian cookery book, but it had the far fancier name of ‘carciofi clafoutis’. You could substitute veggie sausages (recipe to come) for the sausages in this if you are feeding vegetarians. Serve with good old English mustard and gravy

Unsurprisingly the main concern of our politicians is not the innate degenerative processes of authoritarian systems, but how to restore public FAITH in those systems… and, more importantly, how to restore FAITH in the mouthpieces of those systems.
The mood is nostalgic, shot in greyish greens and blues, effectively capturing the general atmosphere of the book. When the future looks dim, the best one can do is to look back and savour what has been. Screenwriter Alex Garland has done an admirable job in being loyal to the source material, visualizing the key events and pertinent scenes, bringing to life the haunting memories of Kathy’s, whose narratives are taken straight out of the book.

I posted some time ago about the excellent cut price Oyster Stout from Marstons, on sale in Lidl's, and the other week I picked up some 500ml bottles of Czech Boheme 1795 (incorrectly labelled as a Pilsner!) for 99p each in Tesco's. Last weekend the same supermarket was offering Pilsner Urquell at 3 bottles for the price of 2, and I noticed on their website such delights as Adnams Broadside, Fullers Bengal Lancer and 1845 at 4 bottles for £5.50. Our nearest Tesco though is one of their smaller stores, and doesn't stock the full range of beers; hence I was unable to pick up the White Shield which was also on the same 4 bottles for £5.50 offer.

So at my sister’s place, when it came time to sit down and eat, I chose white turkey meat, one meat ball, a small piece of ham and some mashed potatoes. I decided it was best to take two Imodium after just a couple of mouthfuls. I only ate about half of what I put on my plate because, it’s best that I quit eating as soon as I get the slightest feeling of being full. It must have been the right amount because I was able to stay out of the bathroom till this morning. After dinner, I politely said no to any drinks and just sipped on water.
If I start running out of ideas, I can always start finishing some of the projects I've started.

And they had this local honey there, too. So we bought a jar. $10, I think it was. But I've heard that local honey is WONDERFUL for allergies. Because it's made using local pollens. The kids and Captain America sure thought it tasted good!
First off -- apologies for the lack of updates and general slowness; I've spent all this past week attending and in transit to conferences with my day beginning promptly at 5am and ending at 9pm, which is an exercise that requires Zen-like endurance (such is the scholarly life!). All yesterday was spent luxuriously doing absolutely nothing of importance or note, and today, with the exception of more reading, catching up, and the Ravens/Patriots and Niners/Giants game (which is certainly something of importance and note) will be more or less the same.
Mothers, take good care of your daughters. Be close to them. Listen to them. Talk with them. Lead them from doing foolish things. Guide them into doing the right thing. See that they dress in a comely and modest fashion. Safeguard them from the terrible evils that are all about them.
A quick note that things with my novel have been going great, and so far some 14,000 people have downloaded the Kindle edition. If you enjoy my reviews and articles, then you may want to check out the book – it’s been getting a lot of really good discussion and reviews.
I will miss the insider camaraderie that exists between my co-workers though I will not miss the frustrations that come with the job. I will most definitely not miss supervising 48 of someone else's little darlings in the cafeteria or the cacophony of slamming lockers and end of day confusion as I herd them off to the open maws of the waiting buses.

…Man is a slave of the society that he created himself. While passing through the desert of his materialisticly oriented life, the more his life turns into a monotonous program of some broken android robot. To change such a destructive course of its existence, he must turn to himself and understand its essence and role in this life, in this dimension.
First we went to the Register of Deeds to request a few extra copies of our marriage certificate. You have to show ID (like your driver’s license) to verify your current address, but if it isn’t up-to-date, you can bring in a utility bill and another form of ID. So I did. Once I presented all of my information, the clerk thanked me for reading their website, adding that no ever does that. And when I told her I requesting the copies as I was moving out of the country she said she “really hoped” I would come back to Wisconsin. Wow. And who says government workers aren’t friendly? ;)
No, Mom, I'm not sorry.

I am a little nervous about beginning to share with my student this time of year. As we return from our April break, the next big break on the horizon is summer. It very quickly becomes the “second to last time…” or the “final…” whatever it is in our daily routines. It won’t be long before they realize that they will be moving on to 6th grade, but the iPads will be staying in 5th grade with me. I look forward to hearing their end-of-the-year reflections about this experience as well as their advice for what I should do with my students next year.

What I’d like to see is the original film be rescanned at 4K and a new master struck that fully represented the original film with the different color scheme and grain structure. Then a lossless presentation of the theatrical 5.1 mix, which could show off the innovative mix that would resemble the theatrical DTS experience. (That would have been amazing!)
The new architectural design preserves much of Ledner’s original ideas for the Maritime Union, like the mosaic stainless steel cladding and circular porthole windows. When daylight hits the reflective facade at just the right angle, the windows appear to float like bubbles in the sky.
Heat another 2 tablespoons of oil to the large pot and add the onions, carrots, mushrooms, and potatoes. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes. Place all the vegetables in the Dutch oven over the beef. Add 2 1/2 cups of the reserved marinade to the empty pot and cook over high heat to deglaze the bottom of the pan, scraping up all the brown bits with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken stock, rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper. Pour the sauce over the meat and vegetables in the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat on top of the stove. Cover the pot and place it in the oven to bake it for about 2 hours, until the meat and vegetables are all tender, stirring once during cooking. If the stew is boiling rather than simmering, lower the heat to 250 or 275 degrees F.

I will start with a quotation from one of my heroines, George Eliot, which I first wrote down in my teens, in purple ink with silver underlining in a miniature ringbinder of blue plastic, adorned with a suitably profound Snoopy sticker, along with various other bon mots which appealed to my dreamy, romantic teenage mind. My teenage days may be long gone, although the tendency to romantic dreams of a more bucolic kind perhaps persist, but I think that Eliot's inevitably wise words are worth repeating.

Happy 2012 everyone! The message is clear: if we are not kinder towards each other - If we don't raise each other up - if we don't become a better species - there is going to be a lot of lemonade to be made.

While FWIW was unable to reach FGG spokesman Seth Faison for comment (not that we tried) Edgar Martins, as usual, spoke for him: “It’s all a bunch of horrible lies,” Martins insisted on behalf of Faison. “Horrible! My clients were busy as little beavers, keeping track of their profits and Andres’ whereabouts – do you have any idea how hard it is to keep track of a drunken skipper on a boat that goes 39 knots and has the seven seas to get lost in? – that they couldn’t possibly be expected to watch their old friend Bernie. The man was the fucking head of the fucking NASD, for Crissake! You think Walter’s gonna call him a crook? Lose a zillion bucks in fees? Go pound sand.”
“Victor!! Oh my dayss are you okay babe?! Please tell me you are!” She screamed. I’m suprised no one has complained about the noise we’re making, *smh*.
For me the Popish Plot is both acutely fascinating, an insight into political pathology, and deeply shameful, even though historians are not allowed feelings in such matters! But these days are over, the hysteria is long gone, my interest is purely intellectual and academic. Not quite, sadly. I felt a renewed sense of shame over the churlish reception of Pope Benedict by some sections of our national community, shamed that his message was being drowned out, as the Spectator lead puts it, by the mendacious caricature of him as a former Nazi apologist for child abuse. It all fits with unregenerate bigots like Ian Paisley, whose imagination has not moved much beyond the days of the Popish Plot, as well as self-righteous clots like the laughable Peter Tatchell, the conscience of all gay-kind. English Catholics deserve better; they’ve earned it, my goodness, how they have earned it.
1) She doesn’t know any better. Ever since her first boyfriend asked her to, she just assumed that that was normal. Lucky for subsequent guys, this chick thinks not swallowing is weird. Don’t question it, let her live in a parallel universe drowned in semen. If she one day stops swallowing, it’s a sure sign that things are going downhill. Maybe you need to give more, if you want to keep receiving more. How to spot her: She opened her mouth and said “ahhh” from the very beginning. There was no warm up period.

Then we installed the mounting brackets. I'm not sure on their exact purpose but I believe it's to protect the wall from getting damaged from the cords. Once they're inserted, the screws are used to pull these little flap thingys towards the wall to hold it in place.

It is a fabulous place! New England has some of my very favorite string joints--Halcyon (Bath, ME), The Fiber Studio (Henniker, NH), Harrisville Designs (Harrisville, NH) are three that I love. I've not yet made it to Bartlettyarns in Harmony, ME, but that's next on the list. Don't waste your time going to Patternworks in Center Harbor, NH. It's really just a glorified LYS and there's nothing terribly special to buy, although the building is lovely. Jimmy and I used to vacation in Center Harbor back in the '90s because it's right on Lake Winnipesaukee, so go there for that.

In high school I had just a few friends. In the early years of my marriage to recently, I had another set of a few friends. Within the past two years or so, I've been making friends by pouring my troubles out to people, but not really keeping in touch with them any more than once every 6 weeks or so. It's like I'm afraid to call my already made friends for fear that they are not going to be available (which would feel like rejection), or that we won't have anything new to discuss and our talk will turn to gossip or judging each other.... Wow, what a negative and fearful view I have of the world! :/

Toward the end of the documentary the filmmakers (very tentatively) ask the octogenarian photographer about his personal life. None of the "talking head" contributors presented as Cunningham's friends know anything about how he lives or where, his background, his personal life, etc. (At the time the film was made, Cunningham was living in one of the fabled rent-controlled studios atop Carnegie Hall, home to many artists over the decades, and were about to get evicted (though relocated locally). Cunningham's studio had no kitchen, the bathroom was down the hall, but he was fine with it -- in fact, it's a point of pride.)
Sliding over to center field we get a couple young guys in the prime of their respective careers. These guys were both speedy with a pretty decent bit of power, Amos Otis a little more consistent with the long ball and Cesar Cedeno a bigger base stealer. Amos was a few years older than Cesar so that they both had their best run about the same time says a lot about the shape of Cedeno's wheels down the line. Also Cedeno was a bit more of a people person back then while Amos was a pretty quiet guy. But they were both having their arguable best seasons when they were selected. Let's see the Al guys now:

Because I'd already read three books this year I'm now ahead of schedule with regard my target, which is slightly worrying. There is nothing more likely to scupper target reaching than complacency, and nothing more likely to instill complacency than being ahead. Whenever I feel I can do something I relax, often to such a degree that I fail to accomplish it. So we'll see. I have a book a friend lent me that I haven't got round to reading yet, the pressure to return it to her is building up, so I'll start that tonight.

Until the global economy pulls itself out of the malaise and greed that has rendered itself ineffective from buying American products and the College graduates do the same then our economy will not rebound at a more progressive rate regardless of what Mitt Romney and the Republicans try to convince us, otherwise. To compare this recovery with that of Reagan’s is to compare apples and oranges.

When I’m jamming on my iPod I feel at ease. I don’t worry about school, my friends, work, or my family; I’m at my version of this utopian awesomeness. The sucky part is that I can’t really describe the awesomeness that I feel when I’m in this bubble. I’m tranquil, happy. I can escape and daydream about whatever the hell is on my mind. I can think freely, and isn’t that what we all want deep down inside?

A reason why reap so little fruit from so powerful a means, is because we assist at it after so cold and tepid a manner. If we reflected, as we ought to do, that Christ labours there for our reconciliation with his eternal Father, as most certainly he does, should we not join with him? He there endeavours to repair the honour our sins snatch from his Divine Majesty, and to satisfy his offended justice. We ought then certainly to keep ourselves at least united to Jesus as much as possible during the time of Mass, that so the Sacrifice may be fully accomplished according to his merciful designs on us.

MUMBAI: A Mulund-based family has accused its son-in-law and his family of murdering its 24-year-old daughter. According to the Jadhavs, Sangeeta, who is survived by two daughters aged 3 and one and a half years, had recently undergone tubectomy with her husband’s consent. But her in-laws, who are based in Vangani, threw a fit when they found out about the surgery and threatened to get their son married the second time as Sangeeta had failed to give them a male heir.

Like I said earlier, I have argued with myself whether or not to share this rather personal experience. It feels weird to type it up like it's just some normal day in the life of Amelia, instead of the weird, surreal and saddening experience that it really was and continues to be. But there are some reasons for sharing that outweigh the weirdness:

In “On Letting Go”–now Part I–I wrote a little about trying to figure out the moment when it was time to let go of my creation and send it out into the world. Part of the obstacle to ever truly embracing that moment is, I think, the fear about how this novel, which I have put so much of myself into, will do out there in the big, wide, and often harsh world. I want, so much, for the people who read my book to love it and my characters and my story like I do. Consequently, I am really afraid that some won’t. That fear is getting a little stronger as the release date approaches.

This is what separates a wanna be writer from a real writer in my humble opinion. It’s relatively easy to get that first draft under your belt. The hard and fun part of writing is editing and honing your story until it gleams or until, if you have to read it one more time, you will violently hurl.

I admit I love the pioneer mama feeling I get from doing these things around the kitchen. Is it ridiculous to admit I love bringing in the wood for the stove? Oh yes. But I know I love it only because it's optional. One morning last week, as I was lugging in a bunch of logs, I was nearly giddy with the prospect of feeding the fire. I put the wood into the stack by the stove and paused to admire my industry, stopping just short of hooking my thumbs into my pretend overall straps and rocking back on my heels with a self-satisfied, "Yesirree."
Regarding the Republican/Democrat Party letter – they talk about voter fraud (they don’t trust the poll judges and want to look for anomalies). Fair enough, but they’ve not proposed any rule to allow the lists released solely for election oversight. They move on to a Pew study on vague “problems” with voter rolls but they’ve had these lists for years but don’t seem to have cleaned them up. Yet again, they also fail to propose a rule for release solely for election integrity oversight. They also have a line on identity theft but fail to mention that a thief/abuser would have thousands of names etc at their disposal with the voter list (rather than scowering websites). What they do is call for all involved to kill the bills and the real reason why they do so:

Then..I stumbled upon this page..scrolled down..reading all of posts from people in the adoption world looking to find family and answers. I didn’t think anything would come of it..but I felt compelled to continue reading on..until I saw an entry that made me forget how to breathe for a few moments.
Also you may notice that I’m directing my complaint squarely at mainstream media. I assume that any niche publication/community that focuses on LGBT fiction has had the same phenomenon as slash fiction: they got bored telling the same bigotry-laden story all the time so they started to branch out. And that’s brilliant because of all of the reasons that I’ve discussed above. But it doesn’t help with the whole normalcy issue simply because people don’t seek out LGBT-focussed publication unless they’re already interested in the subject. But, most people aren’t. Most people read mainly mainstream fiction (hence the name. And despite what hipsters tell you, mainstream is not a synonym for terrible) and most won’t come into contact with anything other than the same, tired story because that’s the only story that mainstream fiction seems to be able to tell.

There are multi-layered concepts projected by this photo, probably one of the most important is that of intra-personal communication, not seen often enough in this age of digital conversation. If you have ever watched a young child enjoying the experience of holding a book, sharing a book with another, you will understand the significance of a facility which allows this to happen.
It was time for war!
As I said, my neighbout died last week. I attended his funeral, and saw some of the Japanese mourning procedures and thought I would share them with you. Bare in mind, Japan is both Shinto and Buddhist, and people are buried according to one or the other, but there are similarities between the two. The ceremony I attended was a Buddhist one.
Blogger has all changed and it's driving me potty. I hope you can view it all properly.
From the nine planets, three of them were only twenty light years from Earth, the Gliese family of planets. Now, Gliese 581c, and 581g have been in the news a lot over the past few years, at least one of them possibly containing life. And thus, these two planets became my inspiration for Alectrona. And here are some facts about Alectrona, the fictitious planet in The Zurian Child:
I've been posting most of my Anthro photos lately directly to Flickr, so I haven't kept the blog up to date. I still get very enthused and want to rush home and "make something".
Exactly one year after Tom Solomon meets Violet Barnes, he surprises her with a ring. By all accounts, Tom and Violet are destined for their happily ever after. However, this engaged couple just keep getting tripped up on the long walk down the aisle.
Gospel humility is not needing to think about myself. Not needing to connect things with myself. It is an end to thoughts such as, “I’m in this room with these people, does that make me look good? Do I want to be here?” True gospel-humility means I stop connecting every experience, every conversation, with myself. In fact, I stop thinking about myself.
I've been held and felt so safe
But four years is an eternity in athletics, and during his exile from the sport sprinting changed. Those who were in his wake during his reign of success (Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell, and Usain Bolt) have all improved DRAMATICALLY. Gay has since won his own sprint double at the World Championships and dropped his bests to 9.69/19.58 and is the current AR Holder in the 100 meters. Usain Bolt won double gold in both Beijing and Berlin and is double WR holder at 9.58/19.19. And former WR holder and rival Asafa Powell has dropped his best in the 100 to 9.72.

Today was one of the last days one could go out and see the roses.
Tin Soldier This one leaves me with an icky feeling before I’ve even read it. Why? When I entered to win (and I enter to win almost everything), there was no mention made that it was the second in a series. Not only that, but I failed to notice that the author was giving away a thousand copies. It’s a self-published book! True, it says it’s published by Spaulding House, but when I checked up on it, the only things I could find were by the same author using a different name. I guess I’m mostly bothered that the contest page now instructs all winners to go buy the first book and says “these are *review* copies for *reviewing!*” Um, again…don’t tell me what to do! Not only that, but it looks like she’s one of those authors that feels the need to respond to negative reviews and critique them. I kind of hope she sees this and decides not to send me the book, I don’t want to buy the first one and I really don’t want to have her attacking me on goodreads or here if I don’t like it (even if it might be fun).
In the past few years I have started watching the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics, actually I probably really paid attention during Summer 08. Anywho, this year's Ceremony was great, I was impressed by the use of the fabric and projectors. It really proves what you can do with a blank canvas and how it can be transformed into something beautiful and inspiring.
The rules say to watch for the emotionally unavailable person. This, I’ve found, is easier said than done. I believe there are several reasons why determining who is or when a person is emotionally unavailable can be so difficult. Face it. No one goes around with a sandwich board on that reads, “Date me. I’m Emotionally Unavailable.” The truth is, we downplay our weaknesses and emphasis our strengths when we meet new people. Yes, you heard me. We lie.
There was a bonfire our last night at the Kinderhotel. When I approached and saw people holding sticks, I assumed we were making s'mores. But they don't do that in Germany; instead, they bake bread. It's disappointing when you're expecting marshmallows and you get bread.

I watched 'How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days' and thought I'd tinker in a little 'How To' list myself. Can I just say MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY IS SO HOT! The first points 1-4 would not be applicable to him, of course. They are only relevant to The Husband when I am trying to avoid Special Love. Which is quite often. And will certainly be tonight. The Husband is out at an Awards Ceremony which he insists is very hard work with all the networking that has to be done when in fact it's just a jolly with free wine. Bastard. He will miss the last train then come in smelling of booze expecting a jolly with his wife. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Anyway, he's left bedtime all to me and that's how I came up with the idea. I have just been in the horror movie which is putting 3 kids to bed. Nightmare On My Street. Or The Bed Time Project. Or some other crap title that I am trying to make funny.
Coop/Charlotte: Coop is still having problems with Mason, but now that the boy is speaking, he’s not listening to his father. Charlotte, still stinging from Coop’s “not his mother” comments, gets in a few digs about willing to help if she were a parent. Coop half apologizes, but Charlotte is still waiting for the real deal. Charlotte also advises Coop to get over his own needs and to be patient with Mason’s petulant attitude. In the end, after Mason witnesses Melody’s interactions with her parents, Mason seems to rethink his attitude and cuddles up with his dad to watch a movie. They invite Charlotte to join them and Coop finally apologizes to his wife, realizing she is indeed going to be Mason’s parent.

Our time in England was surreal for so many reasons, but we were thankful that we were able to be there in England as a family with Jen and Jeff's parents. The Air Force was truly amazing in how well they provided so much and accomodated us while we were in England, always present to help Sam's wife Jen, as well as representing the squadron and the base for the memorial for Sam. There was also a Celebration of Life for Sam in Fulton, Missouri and a graveside service with full military honors for Sam in Medford, Oregon. Jeff's work has been truly remarkable in giving us the time and assistance we needed to travel. We are so thankful for the family we are a part of and the way God provides at just the right time.
Some iridologists even develop their own charts. Differences also exist among practitioner techniques; among American, European, and other approaches; and in the interpretation of specific iris signs.

Since Megan’s birthday was Saturday, I took cake and icecream to school for her class on Friday afternoon. We sang, blew out candles, ate, took pictures, prayed for Megan to be blessed in the coming year and left for the weekend.

It is always wonderful to walk into a wine tasting room and witness the passion that the staff and owners have for their wine. The first time I went to Middelvlei I fell in love with their Free-Run Pinotage, their passion for their wines and on leaving I felt as though I was a part of the family. Middelvlei is the home of the Momberg family who have been wine farming since 1919.

One summer, he and Mom decided that they would drive west to Yellowstone Park. They drove out through the States, then went north and returned by the Trans-Canada Highway. I moved a hundred miles away from home for employment. My brother moved here for a while. He even tried the big city of Toronto, but he was a small-town boy at heart. He moved back to Hicksville, (not the one where Billy Joel was born and raised) got a job and a wife. Dad asked them if they would like to come along.

I finally MOSTLY baby-proofed my porch, so we are good out there and I can watch him there from the kitchen or laundry room, but I really want to make more of the house accessible to him so that I don't have to watch him every second. The living room is sort of okay, and our bedroom is nearly baby-proofed, but the rest of the house needs to be done.

I don't really know how I can express the love and gratitude my heart holds for you today. We don't often interact, in fact, for the last 1 1/2 years you've been residing untouched in the hubs' shed. Sometimes, the hubs and I will look at you and remember why we bought you in the first place. Do you recall? It was when Macie was 10 weeks old, pooped in my brand new car, and walked it all over the back seat. Oh, the memories. You've moved with us from Florida to Virginia and have stayed in that dark shed through record snow storms, nor 'easters and unyielding summer heat. Many cleaners would have given up by now, but not you. You've been waiting around for when I would need you again, and today, Oxy (can I call you that?) was your day.

Maggie never expected her employer to be drop-dead handsome, but she's too intrigued by his offer to say no . . . and too eager to escape a life that made her feel trapped. The deal is strictly business, both agree, until Hank turns out to be every fantasy she ever had.

Oddly enough, trying to get a posse to go to this gig is proving difficult, despite people saying they'd love to go. Family commitments make it tough for many, after all, it's not usual to take a 2 hour train ride at 10am on a Saturday just to get in 8 hours of drinking before turning back, or at least not for them. My wife has encouraged me to go all Saturday. She must be up to something... Anyway, if you're in the area, let me know :)

And so we still have a long way to go to settle in but the benefit of having so many bedrooms - we are only using 4 - is that I can put boxes in two bedrooms and marvel at how lovely the rest of the house is looking and how much we have achieved. Finding anything is another matter but I'm getting very good at remembering what is in boxes. My favourite boxes are those I marked 'stuff'. Not very helpful and just full of junk!

My mother, for instance, when she was married allowed herself to get walked all over, and tolerated really horrible behaviour on the part of my dad, because she was so scared of being left alone. And in the end, all that bending over backwards did absolutely nothing.

to appear, to innovate some of the rusted structures of spirituality. I can certainly agree with this sentiment in many ways, but it is essential to remember that real change begins within our own heart. The maha-mantra is a tool, a spiritualized lifestyle app, which allows us to come to the core of the real innovation and creativity of our true being.
At this point you can add ¼- 1/3 cup cream. Or you can add a tablespoon or so decoratively to each bowl when serving. Or you can omit it entirely and keep it vegan.
And so to my Number One Act. They played two sets; one on the Park stage on Friday and one on the John Peel Stage on Saturday afternoon and they are the all-female foursome from Los Angeles – Warpaint. Warpaint is such a clever name for starters, combining the slang for makeup, thus underlining their gender, with the more tribal connotations of warfare. Their music could also be described as ‘tribal’ being a cross between 1982 Cure/Siouxsie gothic and 1992 Cocteau Twins. It has a peculiar quality of being quite mesmerising without seeming to go anywhere in particular. Somehow, it doesn’t really matter as the heavily chorused guitars chime over intricate bass patterns and complex drumming and you are drawn in forever. Their live vocals could do with beefing up a bit as they don’t quite match the studio versions I now have in my possession on their debut album, ‘Fool’ but otherwise they were beautifully understated, yet wonderful and worthy winners this year.

This Kat is once again in a bit of a panic. Having more or less come to terms with the copyright questions that confronted him in preparing the syllabus for his impending course here, he now has a new problem to deal with in class. Somewhere down the line, he will need to address what might constitute corporate patent strategy. Over the years, he has have developed a list of reasons why a company might build a patent portfolio, big or small. However, what has been happening during the last few years departs radically from the conventional reasons that explain patent activity by a company. How is he going to explain to students the massive patent acquisition deals that have captured the headlines in recent times?

Goodreads Summary: In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community’s Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.
So, this card should be right up his, erm, Case Study...!
It was Friday night, and we’d decided to chill out with a movie and something to eat. Little did I know that “The Fly” (good choice of pre-labour entertainment, eh?) and veggy lasagna would come just a few hours before my son decided to make his debut.
For my next layout, I wanted to include the map of the resort and then added text words from the Technique Tuesday travel set as an embellishment along the side of the map.

I knew I was nowhere, but the most surprising thing of all was that I was still in the world after all still in the world after all this time, on dot at the lower part of the map.

In the amicus application, Johnstone argues that the South African legal system is corrupt and inefficient, by using examples that Johnstone collected from the South African press. These include articles on a military judge who claimed that witchcraft made her attempt suicide, the covering up of crime statistics by former Western Cape police commissioner Mzwandile Petros, and a report from the Law Society Of South Africa which stated that a study of law students from the University of Cape Town found that 70% could not complete simple research tasks or use a computer.

Apparently, YES. A group of older-folk were behind the young bachelors, getting increasingly tizzied (is that a word?) at how slow the guys were playing. One of them, bold and brave James Alonzo Hines (61 yrs), took charge. He rammed his golf cart into the group of guys, and smashed them over the head with his club. He proceeded to demand that they respect their elders. Seriously. That’s not just something old people say in movies.

I’m afraid of allowing myself to get excited for these changes — what if my expectations are raised and they never happen after all? I’ve been so focused on NOT dreaming about these things for so long, I’m afraid to let my mind finally “go there” for fear that they will never happen after all.
Yes. And I was disabused of the notion that the zinc lozenges that my family has always used actually had some effect. We really are a pretty gullible species, and in a lot of these cases, if any of these remedies work, it may be due to the force of our own beliefs, the placebo effect.

For a few weekends straight, my friends and I would look at these covers in curious wonder, we’d all share a laugh about the cover art, asking each other what we each thought these movies could possibly be about, and at times even making up fake and hilarious titles for our own Ilsa film. We did this perhaps, we never had the guts to rent any of these.

We’ve all been there from time to time, but let’s look at cliffhangers and how to use them to create a reader who can’t put the book down.
The Mass Effect series displays these traits right up until the very ending. Once the star child emerges into the narrative, however, all of this is completely thrown out of the window and the creators thrust us into The Epic of Gilgamesh. Moral agency, free will, and humanism are all eschewed in favor of a heavy-handed preachy and ultimately unsatisfying ending. It's similar to my complaints regarding Dan Simmons' Hyperion Cantos.

One thing I’m glad about is that Angelique has got hitched to a local fellow and borne him a daughter. This should discourage the gossip that bedevilled poor Dian Fossey regarding her intimate friendship with her favourite silverback. In truth, no male gorilla could safely mate with a woman. He’d first have to undergo the pussification procedure that Superman subjected himself to before he could pork Lois Lane (see Superman II). Any gorilla that much in love with a woman would deserve to have a coconut dropped on his head from a great height.
You can begin to add beads… Like I said before, the hemp is fairly thick, so if you can, put both pieces of short hemp through, but if only one fits, that works too.
Leaders cannot lead from behind. If you are in a leadership position, you must not only be willing to go before but you must be the first to venture into new avenues.
I have stamped the backing paper onto some Kraft card, using the Large Doily set, and Text It. The text is quite faint, stamped in Antique Linen, and the smaller doilies over stamped in Frayed Burlap.
Not to say that the idea of hitting 430,000 words is tempting and rewarding, but given what’s transpiring in the newly revamped beginning for the book so far, I would never be able to break past the extra 40,000 words tops.

Emma and I walked around the block this morning. It was pretty chilly again, but nice to be out.
I have found myself going in a direction that I was not expecting for a long time, if ever. But suddenly I found myself here and so very happy to know I am going in the right direction even though I cannot see where I will end up, yet. I am trusting that I will get there and end up exactly where I need to be.
While reading this morning all the writings of how this man has impacted many lives far and wide, I paused in wonder... just how many lives he must have had some part in leading to Christ. How many souls will rejoice and reunite with him one day because of his obedience to the Word of God?
The Confederate army had crossed the Potomac River into Maryland from Sept. 4 through 6, 1862, at White's Ford, a few miles below the Monocacy River, and had moved on to Frederick with cavalry fanning out to camp as close as Hyattstown. The invasion would be stopped at the Battle of Antietam on Sept. 17, but Gen. George McClellan, in command of the Union Army of the Potomac, did not know that at the time. Fearing the invading rebel army was intent on attacking the nation’s capitol, he immediately sent troops north to defend the major roads and bridges that the enemy might use.

I didn't get to make "smelly" comparisons between gas grills, gas lawnmowers, lawn-beautification chemicals and 4 chickens right then because the police pulled up and told me to stop blocking traffic.

Shay tilted her head. Maybe Miss Lucy was right. The dress did make the most of her figure. And she had as much right to wear it as anyone. Maybe more—she was born and raised here, after all. It was just a silly old reenactment anyway. No one cared who the bride and groom were.

I like the idea of backyard chickens because it speaks to me of a more laid back, relaxed society. It may be that the cool ocean breezes of Hawaii are still wafting through my soul, but Toronto seemed unnecessarily uptight when I returned home this week.
Bonnie Langford's Mel has been much maligned and called the worst companion of all. Regardless of what you think of Mel (and I quite like her) she fits into this story perfectly, being nice, cute and fun.
This is just the kind of thing about self that annoys self.
Raising the allocation, however, would be tougher, The Bond Buyer reported, because Congress would have to find new revenue to offset lower tax receipts. Then again, it costs more to develop housing in New York City than elsewhere, and not all states use up their volume cap, so there’s an argument for adjusting the volume cap.
One of the complaints I had about the last Nazi exploitation film I watched, Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS, was that the skirts worn by the female SS guards weren't tailored right (they were too long, and, much to my chagrin, completely slit-free). Call my brain structure ill-conceived, but I think the reason there were so many garment issues peppered throughout that film might have had something to do with the fact that the director wasn't Italian. In other words, only someone of Italian extraction, scratch that, only someone who was born and raised in Italy, is in the position to properly comprehend the importance of perversion when it comes to ladies apparel. Well, you know what? Filmmaker Tinto Brass is Italian, and with his Salon Kitty, Nazi couture finally gets its cinematic due. Of course, there's little doubt in my mind that certain members of the audience will be offended by this movie, which at times seems to be masquerading as some kind of fascistic fashion show, but for those who appreciate things that are frightfully du jour, this film is the awkward tribute to totalitarian chic you've been waiting for. I've said once and I'll say it again, the only reason Nazism was in anyway popular as a movement was because of their uniforms. And not those brown, terribly drab outfits they sported during their early days, no, I'm talking about the iconic/infamous all-black uniforms worn by members of the SS (Schutzstaffel), the movement's notorious paramilitary force. They made the person wearing them seem cool, despite the fact that he or she was probably the complete opposite of cool, yet it was this perceived coolness that usually lead them to have delusions of grandeur.
Hello and welcome back to the Paper Shelter Challenges. We have been away for two weeks now and spent that time looking for new team members to join us. WOW! We never in a million years thought that we would get so many applying for a spot on our teams. Thank you to each and every one of you. We will have a hard time chosing between all lovely crafters out there. You all rock! So keep an eye out to find out who our new teamies are. When you least expect them to show up, they will be here! :)
The story of Karna has got to do a lot with how a girl’s curiosity for a “gift” led her to a miserable life which became a curse not only for her but also for her great son whose life was plagued with injustice. It can aptly be said that it is a story of a tragic hero who had royal blood in him but was never considered royal; leave aside the respect and honour he deserved. It is a story in which a warrior gave his life for friendship, even though it meant being on the opposite side of his brothers the Pandavas(who knew nothing of karna’s existence till he was killed by one of them, namely Arjun).
Yes! This way you will be notified if there has been a recall.

What about you? What are your hopes and dreams for your future? Write them down. Has your life unfolded as you’d expected? If not, what’s missing? That’s part of your bucket list. Age is not an excuse. You’re neither too young nor too old to have dreams.
Our DNA equally has a starting point from birth of vibrational output. When we (or as small children, our parents) start placing fear in our lives, our DNA vibration slows down. We get sick, mentnally, physically or both. I was blessed with both by the time I reached adulthood!
It’s the start of a great story when Emma runs into a boy at the beach. That’s Galen. Colliding one moment, two fates are inseparably welded together. Galen is temperamental, funny, witty and snarky, just like Emma. I’m sure that you’ll like these two together. They’re pretty entertaining with all their bickering,

Yesterday it was my grandmother's 79th birthday, it's always really difficult to find a nice present for her since she has everything already :P So I decided to make a pretty cake for her, by myself, for the very first time ever. I've baked things like brownies and cookies before, but never a cake like this, it was a lot of fun and definitely a learning experience (I should listen to the cooking book better! Haha!).

Don’t Shakey-Cam Your Writing: This is a great blog post that includes some guidelines on writing actions scenes. It was written after the blogger saw The Hunger Games, with all of those “shakey-cam” scenes. I think writing actions scenes is one of my weaknesses, so I appreciated this.

It is important to emphasise that such as the proposed securitisation would be grounded in successive batches of “clean” mortgages with prudent loan-to-value ratios deriving from true economic value supported by sustainable purchaser earnings and meaningful equity. Such securities would be readily convertible to cash in the financial markets.

Or maybe you haven’t even gotten around to asking those questions yet. Maybe you’re afraid of what the answer will be or you’re afraid to admit that your trust in God isn’t at 100%. You want to know what I think? Admitting to God your doubts and worries, and asking him those raw questions that eat you up inside, is far better than pretending to understand. Quite frankly, it’s impossible to fully understand how God works. The sooner we realize that, the easier it’ll be for us to be completely honest with God and with ourselves.
Millions of girls freak out when they see even a little bit of cellulite or belly fat. And they resort to extreme measures just to keep up with the standards – diet pills, excessive exercising, self-starvation.

The Obama administration appears to be preparing for a long drawn out war in the Middle East, or at the very least, an expected crisis that will require the need to override Constitutional authority and claim dominion over all resources in the United States under the guise of national defense. With the rise in Disaster Preparedness growing for both individuals and states leading up to yesterday's Executive Order, the mood of the nation points strongly towards some event or disaster that will require massive preparations on a national as well as local scale.

The Underside of Joy is not a fairy tale version of step-motherhood pitting good against evil, but an exploration of a complex relationship between two women who both consider themselves to be the "real" mother. Their conflict uncovers a map of scars -- both physical and emotional -- to the families' deeply buried tragedies, including Italian internment camps during WWII and postpartum depression and psychosis.
The beauty of the Cohn/Levithan collaboration, though, is that they make each other better in what they are already good at. This is especially true for Rachel Cohn. Cyd Charisse is the definition of edge. But the edge in Cohn’s writing is definitely toned down by Levithan’s heart. Luckily Cohn doesn’t lose the edge, of course, but it’s quite understandable that for some the Cyd Charisse series might come over as too harsh, too gratuitous, too much like your typical teen rebel story with a character you will love to hate. However, the typical teenage antics that Cyd is up to, are just that: typical teenage antics, hiding away a lot of anger and especially fears and insecurities (there’s a lot of stuff that is unresolved, especially concerning her ‘Problem’ with the boy of the boarding school).
"And Starfleet Captains are not?" I reply.
The story is told about a woman Zen master named Sono who taught one very simple method of enlightenment. She advised everyone who came to her to adopt an affirmation to be said many times a day, under all conditions. The affirmation was, “Thank you for everything. I have no complaint whatsoever.”

The background was created with Paint Squishings and the dragonfly fairies came from the Sum of All Crafts, thank you Valerie. This was created with my free digi programme so its a bit basic, but quite pretty and fun.
As such, it would be fascinating to see Entre Prises lead a one-off design studio somewhere, making artificial caves a respectable design typology for students to admit they're interested in, while simultaneously pushing sports designers to see their work in more architectural terms and prodding architects to see niche athletes as something of an overlooked future clientele.
Not that a ban makes any difference, Arsenal seem to do very well indeed without the manager on the touchline. Pat Rice has capably stood in Arsène’s shoes – preferring a slightly wider fit but not complaining – although the former captain’s own preference is to take retirement at the end of this season, persuaded to continue for one more year last summer. Talking to the media is something he probably will not miss.
The closet is freshly painted and we're ready to put in the first drawer. (Note to self: Repainting always takes AT LEAST two coats...Never think you can get away with one.)
To the fan of Moby Dick, this piece not only recalls, but extends The Nut, the chapter where Ishmael makes an argument for the intelligence of the Sperm Whale. Quoting German Phrenological legend, Ishmael argues the spinal cord of the whale as nothing less than a series of partially developed skulls. Thus the tiny brain of the whale could be seen as extending the immense length of its carriage.
Perhaps it interests me to find lost internet pages. Perhaps it is like throwing rice in front of an East-European vampire: the vampire must stop and count all the grains, you know. It could be that if I am surfing along quietly to myself, and am brought up short by a 'connection reset while the server was trying to load,' or an 'about: blank' where google's cached page was supposed to be, or a straight up blank page where the internet archive promised me the original page -- well it could be that I feel a certain desire, an inordinate (to some) stubborn desire, to retrieve that page.
“Someone told me that MSN is only a few steps away from playing professionally. Not college—professionally,” I said. “But it’s fun to play soccer against him in gym.”
As you can probably tell, I haven't been blogging much this year. This is for two reasons. I'm quite busy with revising the novel I hope to query late this year/early next year. Secondly, I've lost my passion for blogging. I lost it awhile ago, if I'm to be honest, but I kept hoping it would come back.
It was an absolutely wonderful time. The owners and lead performers were elated that they managed to pack the house even playing opposite Suzanne Vega (I would guess that having six High School students in the troupe and therefore drawing in parents and uncles and aunts and grammas and grampas may have had something to do with that, heh heh, although objectively speaking it was in fact a great time). The overly talkative people at the table behind me (why would you come to a live music performance and then TALK NONSTOP, LOUDLY SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR EACH OTHER OVER THE MUSIC for half of the second set?) even partially redeemed themselves by asking me on their way out if the bass player was my son, because they’d thought I looked like him.
Oh, the boyfriend died? What a Shakespearian tragedy! Seriously, they try to make this whole thing so tragic and whatnot, but really he was a complete cardboard cut-out of a character the whole movie, with no human traits and nothing to distinguish him from the nearest lamppost. So really I feel about as much emotion here as I did the last time I threw out a pair of socks.
“The ancient rabbis—traditional Judaism’s most authoritative sources—almost always interpreted Isaiah 53 with reference to an individual rather than to Israel as a whole or to the righteous within Israel, and this individual was most commonly interpreted to the Messiah.” (60)

Landon's Birthday was a busy busy day! We went to town to get his two year pics taken...what a stud! He LOVED every minute of it!! He was such a poser! I couldn't believe it! I was craking up the whole time.
Many authors, especially those of ebooks, now engage in blog tours to promote their books. My inspiration/role model is my friend, Gene Doucette, who did a 30-day blog tour for his book, Immortal, earlier this year.
Bring the entire mixture to a boil and once it is so, let it simmer in low heat. Add in the bacon and beef and cover with a lid and let it slowly stew for about 2 hours.

Looking at my husband's frustration why things like that happened unexpectedly, I thanked God that He was quick to remind us to not worry and this small problem not be used by the spiritual enemy to dampen both of our spirits. So, there we were, praying about it and committing what needed to be done under His guidance.

I spun and shifted out the window as a rain of bullets pursued me. But like an idiot, I turned around to see where Ms. Valentini was in all the chaos. Another hail of bullets from the front of the house condemned me. I ran, and then shifted into my car.

No wonder the Finns would light bonfires on Easter Saturday to chase the witches away. If it weren't forbidden these days, the Suomenlinna bastions would be perfect locations to build great spring fires. By the time you read this, I will have been up walking on the ramparts, welcoming Easter and shaking my fist, not at the flying witches, but at the falling snow!
These folks are asking people to call, bully and harass the companies that do business with the Sun until we bow and scrap before them and their point of view. The boycott appears to have the backing of the paper Xtra.
We often hear how the Middle East’s failing economies have left many men unable to marry, and some even use that to explain rising levels of sexual harassment on the streets. In a 2008 survey by the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights, more than 80 percent of Egyptian women said they’d experienced sexual harassment and more than 60 percent of men admitted to harassing women. Yet we never hear how a later marriage age affects women. Do women have sex drives or not? Apparently, the Arab jury is still out on the basics of human biology.

Sandy, Sylvia, and Wren have decided that this memorial will be the last My World post. My World was Klaus's baby, and to continue without him doesn't seem right. We will continue to remember and to miss him even as we know he can never be replaced.
I made a schedule to capture 5 minutes of recorded RF, at the start of each of the published timeslots for Cullercoats and Malin Head, as well as Niton and Portpatrick for a full 24 hour period. Not satisfied with 30 recordings to pore over, I next repeated the exercise recording 5 minutes of RF, for 24 hours, on all the timeslots of Torshavn, Orlandet and Rogaland. Even this wasn't enough, and I did another 24 hours worth of recordings, 5 minutes each on the timeslots of Cullercoats, Malin Head, Portpatrick, Niton, Torshavn, Orlandet and Rogaland. I lost count of the number of recordings I now had collected, I think it's 96...
I found a few inspiration photos online, but I don't know how to contact the photographers, so I went to Houzz and found tons of photos.

Then with a loud snap! the whole area lit up like a Christmas tree. Everyone involved covered their eyes as they silently counted down the seconds in which the Shock charge would finish doing its job, before they began theirs.
Chores around the house have been put on the back burner and are done when there is a spare moment, which there are very few. There are also new chores added to my to-do list... well, new isn't really a good word. How about changed... that's a little better. L-A-U-N-D-R-Y. Yup! And LOTS OF IT!!! I tend to wash a load of diapers a day. It may sound strange but I actually enjoy it. I really do. I've always had an enjoyment of doing laundry... the part I don't like doing is putting it away. Well I take that back. Again, putting it all away isn't bad, putting little man's clothes and diapers away, I enjoy very much.
As you begin to undertake your journey into social media, take note of my top 5 thoughts on the unwritten rules of social media and how they can affect your business:
This next image has a very classical pose, executed perfectly by Holly. In this and the previous image I have removed some planks of wood screwed to the wall using the new Content-Aware fill feature of Photoshop, it actually works quite well, and can save a lot of time in cleaning up backgrounds.
The mediocre super-hero movies of this year’s batch. They both had cool things (most of the Thor/ Asgard stuff , and Fassbender). They both also had some fairly glaring flaws (most of the Earth stuff in Thor, and the horrible, over-the-top acting of Kevin Bacon in X-Men). Origin stories are interesting sometimes, and sometimes they feel like setup. These two flicks wound up more on the “felt like setup” side. Thor was the most obviously “engineered for The Avengers” of all of the pre-avengers movies. X-Men seemed to want to establish a new group of actors to play younger versions of these characters, because presumably Famke Janssen, Hugh Jackman, James Marsden are all too fucking old at this point, or have realized they have better things to do. If that’s the case with X-Men, I give it a pass, because I like the new cast. Unfortunately, I fear that Jennifer Lawrence may have something better to do now (what with being the lead in The Hunger Games and all).
Believers are not building the kingdom of God on earth today. They are snatching brands from the coming fire before the day of salvation is finished (1 Cor. 9:19; 10:33; 2 Cor. 5:11, 18-21; 6:2; Jude 23). Today the “whole world lieth in wickedness” (1 John 5:19), and the devil is its god (2 Cor. 4:4). The apostles and prophets in the early churches (as described in the book of Acts and the Epistles) did not band together to accomplish grandiose social-justice projects; they did not pursue artsy activities; they did not try to save the earth; they preached the gospel and shined as lights in this dark world by their holy lives. Christ’s Great Commission emphasizes gospel preaching (Mat. 28:18-20; Mk. 16:15; Lk. 24:46-48; Acts 1:8). After Christ rose from the dead and as He was preparing them for His ascension, the disciples asked Him, “Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?” (Acts 1:6). Jesus’ reply is very instructive. He did not correct their understanding of the establishment of a literal kingdom of earth. He told that it was not time for that long-expected kingdom to be established and that our duty in this church age is to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth. “And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Acts 1:7-8). After this, Christ ascended to Heaven and poured out the Holy Spirit upon the disciples to empower them for this great work. This commission of world evangelism will not be abrogated until church age saints are removed from this world and the Lord regenerates Israel and restores them to the front burner of His plan for the ages.

This is just what the world is now. We don’t live in small villages surrounded by our families and other families who practice the same beliefs and cultures anymore. Well most of us don’t. I do know some Malaysians who only hangout with people of the same race. I guess it’s very safe and comfortable, doing stuff your parents taught you and having good friends who follow the same set of beliefs, but that is up to the individual. I know that I don’t do safe or comfortable very well, and although it can be tiring, and confusing, and sometimes just frustrating being pulled in two and sometimes five different directions, taking this path has been amazing. I’m not pro or against anything. I’m just saying that if you tilt your head just a bit, things might look different, and less negative. The things I’ve seen, the colourful people in my life, the different opinions I’ve heard, it has so far been a wonderful journey and I think because we grew up the way we did, things are not black and white anymore, there is a rainbow of colours in between, and this is where I live, between different cultures, each beautiful in their own way.
As Master Distiller Harlen Wheatley puts it, "aging barrels in different environments affects the taste of the whiskey. There has always been much discussion about warehouse placement, even among ourselves, so we're anxious to hear how others rate these bourbons."

"The performance was followed by a little birthday party for Avery in the Dining Hall. Avery is now 13, an accomplished student. Karla was especially proud of Avery and excited to get together to celebrate Avery's first birthday as a teenager. It was as perfect a family afternoon as we could hope for. Had we known it was our last day, it would have been heavy, overbearing, not the gift that it was, light hearted, buoyant, playful. As we walked out to our car to drive home, Karla handed Abby a purple balloon that one of the staff in the dining room had given her. And Abby, distracted for a moment, lost hold of the string and the balloon rose up into the sky. No one was very much concerned. The girls are almost too old for balloons. But there was something about it, as it rose into the sky that struck me, and I felt drawn to watch it. So I stood there, away from the group, feeling a bit silly, almost obstinate, and I stared after the balloon as it rose into the gray sky. Abby wandered over, and grabbed me around the knees and watched with me. Every now and again asking "Do you still see it, Dad?"
These truths don’t even begin to scratch the surface of what Jesus suffered for you and me. His was a bitter cup, but one that He drank of willingly so that we might be saved, (Luke 22:41-42).

* Notes on Oyate from Wikipedia: In January 2008, the Lakota Freedom Delegation split into two groups. One group was led by Canupa Gluha Mani (Duane Martin Sr.). He is a leader of Cante Tenza, the traditional Strongheart Warrior Society, that has included leaders such as Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. This group is called Lakota Oyate. The other group is called the “Republic of Lakotah” and is led by Russell Means. In December 2008, Lakota Oyate received the support and standing of the traditional treaty council of the Oglala Tiospayes.

From a seated, cross-legged position, inhale to lengthen through the crown of the head. As you exhale, drop the right ear to the right shoulder. After 2-4 breath cycles, gently tilt the head so your nose and chin are pointing down towards the right leg. Remain here for 2-4 breath cycles, then return your gaze straight ahead. Staying on this right side, gently place your right hand on top of your head to intensify the neck stretch. After 3 additional breaths, release the hand & return your head to an upright position. Repeat on the other side.
Serve with fresh egg noodles (blanched) and watercress, bok choy, yu choy or iceberg lettuce (I prefer watercress, it's peppery taste goes well with the duck).
Be specific! Because our lifestyle is normal to our kids, it is hard for them to express their thoughts about it and put them into words. Asking a child from an average household how he feels about eating packaged cereal, will get you the same blank stare as asking one of mine how he feels about eating bulk cereal.
As you can see, we have listed one specialized area of study for each day. I will be honest here and tell you that we do NOT do each of these each week. Some weeks are good if we manage to do two or three of them, and on others we have actually done all five. My attitude about not getting to the "fun" and "special stuff" every day is that while everyone needs goals to aim for, we should also be content in doing our best...and since we are trying pretty hard, I think our best (for the time being) is actually quite good...though there is always room for improvement.

Just wanted to let you know why I haven't been blogging recently. Over the weekend I was helping my mother-in-law move out of the home my wife's family lived in for over 40 years (and helping finish off a sixtel of Victory Sunrise Weiss), and there was no Internet connectivity. Monday morning I left at 6 AM for Pittsburgh, visiting Roy-Pitz Brewing, Red Star, and City Brewing on the way to an event at the Teutonia Mannerchor in the evening.
A Virginal by Ezra Pound
Art has the capacity to evoke a range of emotions from the viewer, whether it be religious fervour, nostalgia, romance or even horror. Valentine Green’s engraving, Youth rescued from a Shark (1779), is designed to portray what was seen as, and to a large extent is still considered, one of the most feared aspects of the ocean – a shark attack.

“That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; The eyes of your understanding being enlightened.”
This story is in response to a photo prompt from Madison Woods for her Friday Fictioneers. A big thank you to her for running the show. Read below for more information shamelessly copied from her page.
She had a few other funny stories like that, but she began to share more about her husband. Since I had the time, I listened. She said they were married for 57 years and that he was her best friend. After he got sick, he asked if he could go home to die beside his wife. He died in her arms. Her husband died a few years after her oldest son died. Hearing these things made me tear up, but Polly just smiled. She is confident that she will see them both again someday and realizes that life is short for all of us.
This is also an example of how a miniature setting can be created with items typically found around the (full-sized) house, a special dwelling does not always have to be created, just re-purposed. A spare bookshelf or an empty cupboard or crate, or any number of other containers may work just fine.
Let us grant all that; we are generous souls. What then remains that all sides and parties agree upon — that involves neither actual nor implied misunderstandings?
Once the temple that was Jesus was destroyed, it was rebuilt. First it was seen as Jesus’ resurrected body but after that a new temple was built; God’s glory dwelt throughout whole world through the Holy Spirit living in those who believed in Jesus. Jesus had promised on the night before he died that anyone who loved him would obey him and as a result God and Jesus would dwell in them. God’s temple is now the Church, the Church being the people not the building, however beautiful that building might be.

3) Photo, CEA Registration and SST course – Take your photo and register yourself with agency AFTER you have received a notification that you have passed the exam from your Approved Exam Administrator. You will then need to go to PICTUREME at Suntec City Mall or your approved company photographer to do a photoshoot for your passport-sized photo for your company business cards. The studio will have the uniforms (as required by ERA) in the studio for you for the shoot. Once your photo is taken (usually 8 copies), ask for a soft copy on a disk and together with a printout of your results slip, go to your estate agent’s HR Dept and register with them. Here, the HR Dept will assist you to register yourself with the Council for Estate Agents (CEA), who is the governing body for estate agents, to obtain your license and sign up for the Sales System Training course. Your registration with CEA will entitle you to your CEA Registration Kit (including your ID tag) and your CEA Starter Kit (which includes your all-important 200 business cards). Cost – about SGD 40 for the photos, SGD 620 for the Sales System Training course, SGD 290 for the CEA Registration Kit and SGD 180 for the CEA Starter Kit.

Josh Beckett is one of the most talented pitchers of the last fifty years. You could probably go back a hundred years. Beckett was the second pick of the 1999 amateur draft, behind Josh Hamilton, who is of course one of the most talented hitters of the last 50 years. Beckett is 6-foot-5, and in his best days he threw a 100-mile-per-hour fastball, a mind-bending curve and a pretty decent change-up that seemed like piling on. He could, at his best, throw all these pitches for strikes with regularity, and he could strike out big league batters with any of those pitches. In his first full year in the minors, he struck out 203 in 140 innings, walked just 34, went 14-1 with a 1.54 ERA. He was otherworldly.
Therefore, as you are impressing your boss with being more productive, you get to prepare and train yourself for future leadership roles at the same time while being on stand-by for it. Isn’t that great?
Once upon a time, there were two poets. For the sake of anonymity, we will call one Emily and the other Sylvia. They were both extremely good writers - modern yet accessible, challenging yet mellifluous, edgy yet musical. They each kept a wary professional eye on the other’s successes and failures. Because they were decent human beings, they tried to rejoice at the former and not to rejoice at the latter. Sometimes they managed this better than other times, but still, they tried.
Plot is good. Characters are well thought of – especially in the Joseon times. Oh, specifically our Joseon F4 Rangers! Music is appropriate. Let’s see what the next episode has to offer. I hope I get to have more of that funny scenes or maybe even better.
Mr. O’Donnell has repeatedly broken the code of ethics for the Society of Professional Journalists. When companies hire and employ people who feel that their perception of things is more truthful than the facts themselves, then they need to be removed from a position of influence to unsuspecting listeners or viewers. Mr. O’Donnell has repeatedly failed to do his homework on many of his comments and thus has broken the very code of ethics he is required to follow by his profession.

Crocodile on the Sandbank is a must-read historical mystery. As The Guardian’s Maxim Jakubowski so aptly claims, it is filled with “dastardly deeds, whirlwind romances, curious mummies and all the fun and intrigue of Egyptian excavations, with a heroine who wields a sturdy parasol rather than a magnum. Accomplished entertainment.”

The administrators notified the Florida Department of Education, the Orange County School Board and Columbia College where Jackson-Burch had been a student for three years, that she had cheated, and refused to validate her TABE test score for eight months, causing her to miss out on a pre-planned nursing course, according to the lawsuit.
Fundraising was always going to be difficult. As a full-time student away from home, saving up for something as expensive as long-haul flights and seven weeks on the ground in Tanzania is no small ask. But I wanted it more than new dresses, more than weekend meals out, more than train tickets to visit my friends. By the time the next Read training day came around in February, I’d put aside close to half of what I thought I needed.

Hi everyone and a very happy Monday morning to you. Lynsey here with this week's challenge and my theme for you this week is to 'A card a matching tag'.
The world is big, and we're constantly learning. Sometimes the learning happens when you're alone, sometimes with just one other person, sometimes in a large group. These are just a few ways that unschoolers can and do find knowledge and learning:
Oh, I could go on and on with how we also get a great street-level villain in the gun-toting murderer Boddicker as essayed by Kurtwood Smith. He makes it look easy, as a man who finds himself in his element blasting holes in cops and overseeing huge explosions, not to mention flinging useless cohorts out of moving vehicles. Paul McCrane is also very good as Emil, a twisted little piece of work who more than meets his match and, just like Ferrer, leaves the film in grand fashion.

Memories: all in the mind. The summer months since we returned from Ireland have been so busy that my promised 'Irish Journal' has been on the back-burner, until meeting again some of the people from the Caravan Writers' Guild with whom we shared that marvellous journey prompted me to continue. In essence, I was back with our motor home, boarding the Stena Line ferry (so quick and easy, so smooth a crossing, free WiFi; and so simple the disembarkation when we arrived in Dublin port). Approaching the Irish coast, I am looking again for THAT GREEN - a green peculiar to Ireland that I remembered from previous holidays - but it's evening and instead I am captivated by the misty blues, greys and purples of the Wicklow Mountains, silhoutted against the pearl of an early evening sky.

4. Why aren't we taught the whole truth about Columbus' actions and the devastating consequences of those actions? Why are we only told about Columbus, who as a boy who always wanted to sail and then when he got older Spain provided him three ships & he sailed across the ocean andDISCOVERED A NEW WORLD! (where millions of Taino had lived for thousands of years and which we now call the Caribbean Why are we only taught about that FIRST voyage, and not the other 3 voyages, when all hell broke loose? Why aren't we taught about how on the second voyage, unlike the first when Columbus only had 3 small old ships, Columbus was given 17 large ships and 1,500 armed men eagerly signed up for the chance to go to the "New World" with hopes of getting rich quick on the gold to be found there?
I wrote early in the year about my daily art project for 2012: every day I hand-stitch a design onto a four-inch square of solid-color cotton. A third of the way through the year already, and I'm pleased to report that I'm still having fun (the most important thing in a daily project, because it would be grim to have to slog through 240 days of something you don't enjoy, and equally grim to abandon your resolution).
Now can anyone who has not experienced this please take a moment to imagine the layers of pain and shame and inner-torment this situation causes, when it has been lived over and over and over again, for months, years, decades in some cases.
Keeping such secrets and automatically reverting to a minority language whenever the law is in sight or could hear, creates a disconnect from integration and an economy and rule of law within the national economy and national rule of law (such as it is). That can only be a strategic weakness when attempts are made to combat serious and organised crime, whatever the ideology for involvement in it.

They spend so much time studying, it will be nice to have them more freed up and relaxed.

On Pinocchio: Okay, I don’t think you can really blame a small child for taking advantage of an escape option if it’s presented instead of trying to take care of a baby, particularly since he was obviously in a situation where he couldn’t do much. HOWEVER:
Here’s a story about Draupadi and Bheem I heard a long time ago. At the time of her marriage to the five Pandavas, she had declared that she would spend one year with each of the brothers and during that year, no other brother would enter the chambers that she and her husband-of-the-year shared.

To all of us who stood on line on this date to see the premier of the latest Star Wars film, we remember. Star Wars opened and play at the Cinerama for a year in Honolulu when I was in high school (and it turns out a certain President of the United States was also known to head down to the Cinerama to see Star Wars that year in Waikiki). Hawaii is a great place to grow up, but on cloudy days there is only so much one can do - go hang out at Ala Moana Shopping Center or go see Star Wars at the Cinerama.

I linked a great author to this blog. Pier Anthony Jacob (Pen name). I hope he will tell me hello. I arrived at the central airport in Denver in 1978, and fumbled around for my luggage, and retrieved them sans the Janet Nepalitono scrutiny. Folk's, this is before the issues we face now. Lets get back to the story. My hospital bought a Unirad Machine. Yep (Johnson and Johnson). Many of you know what we are talking about. It was like Keith Emerson's Monster Moog. OMG! and here I am tryying to learn how to use it.
Today was an extremely busy day for Me, and I just happened to be in one of My unpredictable moods - and one just never knows what that might mean for My clients. So today I didn't feel that I was in the right frame of mind to let My client's masturbate. I felt like being mentally sadistic, so I inflicted the most severe kind of torture, simply because it was My desire to do so. My slaves are here for My pleasure and entertainment, so I was perfectly within My rights. I decided that today all of My clients either had to be bound with ropes or cuffs, or rubberized and then teased mercilessly with My wonderful Venus. When they came very close to releasing, I simply clicked the Venus to the "off" position and set it aside with no intention of using it further. Groveling and begging didn't help their cause one bit, although there was a lot of it. I think I even saw tears. But I was all about creating sexual frustration today. I succeeded as I left them with extremely engorged genitals. And no, it isn't just a matter of time before they can go home and "fix" their little problems in the privacy of their own bathrooms or bedrooms. Some of them were so frustrated they might have even tried in the elevator on the way down. But no, I couldn't allow that. Because I need to constantly amuse Myself at the expense of my clients and slaves, I decided I'd keep today's prisoners in chastity and the only way they would be set free is to come back in a week or go to a locksmith..... I think they'll be coming back, begging for me to offer up the chastity keys that I placed on my key-ring. Unfortunately, there's no telling what mood I might be in when they return. Hopefully, for their sakes, it will be a merciful one. God I love this job!

Isn't it funny how when we work somewhere the battles of that organization become our battles. Once removed, they seem so unimportant. Every thing at Tedious Systems was portrayed as life or death.

Interestingly, the doctor told me that acupuncture would not help! He wrote a bunch of chicken scratch in my medical booklet to show to the nurse behind the medicine counter. I thought it looked kinda crazy, even for sloppy Chinese characters. I asked one of my Chinese friends to translate it for me and they said they couldn’t read it. After I made a comment about how doctors in America also have illegible handwriting, they clarified that although the writing was sloppy, the primary reason they couldn’t read it was because it wasn’t Chinese! It wasn’t pinyin either. Doctors in China have a special language that no layperson can read. How useful.

The lesson here, is that you should always stop at red lights.
Nationalism says that our most basic form of political order is advanced tribalism: people are united by culture, heritage, language, customs, values and descent from ancestors not political ideology, like “capitalist democracy” versus “socialist authoritarianism,” Rule of Law (which they are suspending to cope with problems of immigration).

It makes sense, doesn’t it? Scenes like The Call To Adventure and Crossing the Threshold (and on the darker side, the Visit to Death or All is Lost scene) are magical moments: they change the world of the main character for all time, and as storytellers we want our readers or audiences to experience that profound, soul-shattering change right along with the character.

I mentioned it a fortnight ago, but I had since had second thoughts, the usual talking myself out of it, and then back into it again! does this sound familiar to any of you? But after much encouragement from friends and also my family I finally decided on Friday to go for it, and I signed a contract to open my own little crafting haven! Now , for those who know me well, you know I'm still very nervous about it all, worried sick I'll fail , but i gave myself a good talking to (oh yes , I am mad!).

Athena has performed with Michael Flatley on Broadway as well as the brilliant Michael G Rose. Juliet and I have had the pleasure to listen to Athena play on every occasion to Terralsole and each time we have been moved by her genius. Athena is a gracious host and is one heck of a cook.

My little girl turns 1 today (2-15). I.cannot.believe.it. Seriously, are you kidding me? How could these 12 months fly by as fast as they did. To all the experienced mamas out there...you were right. Time flies. To be quite honest, it's very bittersweet for me. I don't really have a baby anymore, but I am so looking forward to all the fun times we're going to have together in the near future. Leah is absolutely amazing and probably the cutest one year old you'll ever feast your eyes on.

I layered a couple of different types of paper including some vintage piano rolls. I airbrushed using my Copic airbrush attachment and some Coffee Break stencils--I use the large X-holes and the numeric stencils. It's amazing how much depth you can get with just two stencils and switching off between different colors. I used a couple of different yellows along with the teals. While the yellow is not as prominent, it does give the teal some variation.

It is easier for me to imagine raising two boys because I've been raising a boy for over 3 years. That imagined life is full of joy and love. Before Camille I never had this huge desire for a girl other than it would be fun to see what she looked like. I was such a tomboy growing up, Super rough and tumble (I'm way more girlie now). The thought of pink sparkles and tutus seemed overwhelming. I know each child is themselves and having an older brother influence will have an impact but you know what I mean. Like I said we didn't know Camille was a girl and she was due in July...IT IS HELL here in the summer...I mean out of control hot and we knew we would have everything if we had a boy and I am super practical. No nursery was set up, only diapers and one pack of white onesies were purchased. No baby shower...nothing. I can't tell you how many times I have cried that I never bought even ONE little dress. It BREAKS MY HEART!
Now, fortunately Harry’s class clown reputation preceded him and I managed to get the Supervisor to see reason. Harry then complained about my choice of parking position, and pointed out I must be a baby for liking kid toys like the ball in the back seat of my car. I responded, falsely, by saying the ball was going to be a gift for him but as he clearly didn’t like it I would just keep it for myself. I then spent rest of the car trip taking every red light as an opportunity to pivot in my seat and belt out Roxette tunes into his face, much to his squirming dismay.

Most Mondays I am just dragging and wishing it was Friday already. Not that I don't wish it was Friday but I got some good sleep last night thanks to Logan for sleeping 6 hours through, so I actually feel pretty good for a Monday. The weekend flew by as usual but I still managed to get a few things accomplished and will be showing you the finished products this week. Today I am showing a 1st birthday invitation for a good friends daughter. I can't believe Gracie is going to be ONE already! Time really does fly by with the little ones. This is going to be a fall themed birthday party that includes pumpkin decorating and a hay ride for the kids. How fun! Hope you like it.

Cambies was completely packed with people. No surprise there, as it is one of the most popular bars in Downtown, Vancouver. Lucky for the INTERNeX group we were there early so we avoided having to stand in the long, long line! Cambies is a great place to find cheap beer, an awesome atmosphere and fun people. There are really big tables that can accommodate a large group such as ours and the music always gets you in the mood to party.
Remember my borrowed begloved finery? Have you ever tried eating and drinking with Long Kid Gloves on? Take my advice. Don't. They make your fingers thick and clumsy like thumbs. I managed to hold onto the champagne (goblet not flute, of course), taking large swigs to calm my frayed nerves. Then, having been too strung up to eat anything beforehand, I slipped into the Ball Supper room, spread with a sumptuous buffet, for a tiny snack. The rarest of roast beef from the royal herds and pink poached salmon with cucumber scales lay on ornate silver dishes. Fishy eyes stared disapprovingly as I tried to manhandle glass, plate and cutlery with increasing desperation. Cutting beef with a fork? One handed? With gloves on? When you're a klutz? Just before everything tipped off the plate and all over some unsuspecting duchess, I put it down and decided to go hungry. Snacks were off the menu and The Long Kid Gloves had won. More champagne, that was the answer, and some serious people-watching.
I have a lot of books in my apartment, most of which I am very fond of, and would hate to loose, but I suppose I could live without should the need arise. But by far the most precious ones are the lot sitting on the two top shelves of the bookshelf just to the left of my desk. These are all my old notebooks, chronicling my sightings of birds, insects, snakes, plants and sundry other organisms since I was about 14 years old. In case of fire they would be the first I would save after wife and kids.

I think the line between the reactions might be in the expectation of change.
As I sat in my third grade classroom in PS 179 I could hear them roaring towards us. From my desk I could look out the window and see their long yellow roofs. They parked in front of the school entranceway on Avenue C. With their diesel engines just clattering away, I knew it was my time to go. On every Wednesday at 2 o’clock my stomach would start to hurt. It was time for the public school Christians to leave our sanctuary of bliss and head North up East 3rd street to The Immaculate Heart of Mary school. It was time for “Religious Instructions”.
One of the things that might be said about the safest parts of these United States is that the safest areas, I would venture, are areas where more citizens own guns. Liberal areas, which usually include the large cities and their immediate suburbs, are usually areas with fewer legal guns and more illegal ones in the possession of criminal or criminally-prone people.
Let’s assume that this technology will eventually land you a contact lens with an inbuilt screen that you can actually scan and read normally.
For now, I’ll just keep the beard. Beyond that, I am what my mom made me and I’m sure that at some point she’ll tell me what needs changing. I'll get myself straightened out and post some more here soon.

Instead, four people holding prominent positions in the city would be allowed to each appoint one person. The president of the Floyd County Bar Association, the New Albany Postmaster, the principal of New Albany High School and the chancellor of Indiana University Southeast would each be given one selection.

We didn't get the best prints, though we did discover that poster paint works better than acrylic, as acrylic paint dries too fast, and it's hard to get the paper folded in time, making for incomplete pictures...
I remember her dark brown hair and eyes, but not much else. I was enamored with her, entranced, and I would follow her all around the area like a lost dog. So when she suggested a new game to me, which she called “Married,” I wasn’t about to turn it down.

Alright, kids, we've got white-out conditions here in Cleveland, and somehow when The Boss compared his pink Cadillac favorably to a Subaru, I'm sure he wasn't referring to this kind of weather. All-wheel drive might be nice about now.
I checked the time, I had 1 hour and 30 minutes before the bus leaves the station. I knew it was a long way but if I ran towards the statue I could just make it. The photo above was the taken from the location I had decided to run for it. I forgot to mention, at the time i was carrying a small over the shoulder bag with my netbook inside. Making the run slightly more difficult.

I’m so cold lately. Come warm me.
I'm working from home for the day. As you might have noticed in the picture above, my little pup has a hurt paw so I'm home taking care of him today. He was playing with another dog last night during the game and got a toe nail stuck in the carpet and ripped it out. It was the little guy's first injury. I may or may not have teared up slightly.
hellow people, how yall doing, I havent uppdated about how weekend has been and how it went because i have been in a bad mood the all day today since i wake up, i didnt have the time to do anything or talk to anyone today as well, its because when am in a bad mood, i love being alone and keeping it all into me. so far, i cant say what destroyed my day and why i aint feeling well but atleast one thing that changed my day is ARSENAL,
As I have not bust a nut in nearly 3 months I have trawled the interwebs many times over – looking under every rock and through every cache dump for good porn that I have not already seen. I feel much like those hard pushed trawler men, squeezed by EU regulations and despairing over the depleted stocks – they work the same land, float over the same space, and come up with the same shit, maybe many times over.
“When you are in a scene, you are engaging in a relationship. Not the relationships in the plot – a relationship with your fellow actors on stage.”
We've come a long way downhill since those critical decades. Today, the suggestion that there should be any topics, any areas of enterprise, or any venues of human interaction deemed off limits to the State is considered "controversial." Property is now considered conditional. A man's body is a thing to be regulated and "protected" by political force. Even freedom of speech is widely regarded as a charming vestige of a primitive time: something our forebears could tolerate, but which our "more complex era" cannot afford. In all things, the needs of the State come first -- and woe to him who thinks to stand in its way.
Four years ago, as we realized the time was very near, a couple of my brothers and I talked about it and I said I would do the eulogy. I asked everyone to send me something they wanted to say and somehow the eulogy wrote itself. I understand now that its because my mom lived how she wanted to be remembered.
The question became: how do you compare perfection? I changed my mind well over a dozen times trying to separate these women into some “order”. In the end I found myself comparing their overall bodies of work and finally selecting – Sally Pearson (AUS). She literally competed all year long as she started sprinting competitively during the Australian summer season at the end of January! She won Australian titles in the 100 & 200 in addition to her specialty 100 meter hurdles.

My son graduated from Duke in 2006 and majored in chemistry and economics. I got my monies worth. But I lament that my Alma mater employs, even promotes, such lunatic fringe.

Recently, my son Max's preschool sent out an email alerting us that an antisemitic group would be staging a demonstration at their facility. His preschool is part of a Jewish Community Center (JCC), an institution that is a fitness facility and hosts arts, cultural, youth and senior programming, and is open for membership to anyone. While I don't know much about the protesting organization, I know they don't particularly like Jewish people, homosexuals, or young men and women who died while serving in the military.
love this time of year!
We ended up giving Jess back to the breeders too. Our son just wasn't bonding at all and my long awaited 30th Birthday present just turned out as a complete disaster and was ripping the family apart, rather than bring us together, the stress from all directions was becoming unbearable, and at one point my fiancé and I were arguing so much I nearly moved out!

Just enough time to get out to PS1 before it closed. Having never been on my previous trips to NYC, I was excited about seeing the building and a show of new works. Building? Cool. Show? Meh. Waaaay too many poorly executed video installations, though there were a couple I liked. There was an overall lack of craft and technique in the show. I love modern, abstract art, but please kids, don't just glue a bunch of crap together (or melt glass bottles and feathers into a slag heap) and expect me to be impressed.

All of the damage in my municipality was caused from lots of snow and a quick melt. After many early morning meetings and a couple of late nights, we feel that we are now in pretty good shape as far as the road repairs being done. We’ll cross our fingers that we don’t get anymore really fast melts (there is still some snow out there) or lots of rain – both would cause our problems to start again.

Her decision was not an easy one. It took guts to toss away the reminders. Sooner or later everything we own becomes junk.

3. On the subject of minimalism, simplicity and decluttering, this week I met in real life a wonderful woman whose blog I've been following for a long time, for two years (shortly after she began blogging in March 2010). Colleen of 365lessthings.com who lives in Australia has been on holiday in the US for a couple of weeks with her husband, and they had a long layover in Los Angeles. After emailing back and forth, we decided to meet at The Getty Center for a few hours. Just think, if the internet didn't exist, if we didn't have similar interests, we would never have met! I'm so glad we did, both virtually and physically.

Flavor: After the initial refreshing sensation of the cool liquid, an immediate hop presence is experienced, with a firm hand shake and slap on the back for the taste buds in the mouth. Then a sharper hop flavor, not quite citric, not quite metallic, washes through the aromatic sensors and remain comfortably ensconced on the rear of the pallet.

it is a beautiful spring day, one in a series of beautiful days, and i woke up this morning feeling that it was time to sit and write about my True Colors experience. truth be told, i wasn't able to keep up with the regime all the way to the very end, as others did; yet, the group stalwartly and kindly continued to send my big ol' journal of Metallics (dubbed by Lynne as Heavy Metal, it is ENORMOUS...what was i thinking?!) around until everyone had done a page or two in it.
I have had several cars over the course of my driving lifetime. The original car: The Jetta. It was older than I was, only one radio station came in and that was only because I had a giant nail in the place where antennae should have been. There was black electrical tape along the side of the back driver side door so it would match the rest of the siding (the car was white but had black strips on the sides). It was the car that left a puff of black smoke behind as it pulled away AND the windshield leaked when it rained! I live in Western Oregon. IT IS ALWAYS RAINING!!!!!

I've spent part of my late afternoon and early evening emailing with one such touchy moderator who didn't like my tone when I called 4e what it is: a dead system. It's as dead a system as OD&D, or Basic, or 2E, or whathaveyou. I define a dead system as one not currently supported by its property owners. With 5e, the death-knell has been sounded on 4e - it's worse than that, it's dead Jim.
The short story I read was The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster (which I believe is available for free online and in e-book format). I read it as part of my ongoing interest in dystopian and apocalyptic literature, and while Forster has some disturbing insights into future life that could easily be applied in today’s world, the story doesn’t have much in the way of plot or characters; it’s more of a platform for Forster to get across some of his ideas. It’s still worth reading, though, if you are interested in how authors envision the future.
The Dark Days series is waiting for you. The six-book series follows the roller-coaster adventures of a centuries old vampires named Mira and her companion, a vampire hunter named Danaus, as they race around the globe, fighting creatures determined to crush the human race. When they have spare time, they are either fighting each other or fighting their attraction for one another.
Seriously. The numbers don’t lie. Of the over 40 million children in the USA, just about 150-200 are kidnapped (in the traditional sense, by a “bad guy/stranger”) each year. Less than half of that number ends up dead. All those missing child statistics out there are very misleading and do not account for the fact that most of those reported missing are runaways, kids who were taken by another parent, kids who are late for curfew, kids whose parents mixed up who had visitation that weekend, and so forth. Sites which claim that a child “goes missing every 40 seconds” are not being forthright the situation involved in that missing child report.

We managed to be near the front of the pack which is great. The beginning of the walk is thru the main downtown street and it usually gets bunched up and slow there. It is fun because a lot of the restuarants have outdoor seating and they get a free floor show and we get a lot of cheering on - but it does slow us down.
How did this photographer get on your list? In addition to documenting the why you should also note the how. From a marketing perspective it’s good to know how people are finding you, clients, colleagues, potential employees or otherwise. Note how you found them on your list so that you can refer back when asked. You will also be able to start tracking if there are any patterns in which sources you are using have the highest rate of return (ROR) for landing a job.
March Bonuses are tabulated. Bonuses are a cultural thing as well. I look down the list and see 6 from one agency and thousands of dollars and then one or two small ones from another. It’s easy to see your culture from the bonus chart. Three of the top 5 in all of AIL are Altig agents. Alan Sedaghat. $8,158. He’s at #2 in ALP in the whole company with $156,664 of ALP for first quarter so far. That’s on pace for $600,000 this year. Katie Massart got $5,826. Ryan Bisanz. $4,743. He was at the SWAT meeting. Great, great guy. Over a million and a half given away last month if you add it all up.
The Life Path 6 suggests that you entered this plane with tools to become the ultimate nurturer, and a beacon for truth, justice, righteousness, and domesticity. Your paternal, or maternal, as the case may be, instincts with a 6 Life Path exceed all others by a considerable margin. Whether in the home or in the work place, you’re the predominant caretaker and family head. While the 6 may assume significant responsibilities in the community, their life revolves around the immediate home and family, for this is the most domestic of numbers. Conservative principles and convictions are deeply ingrained and define your character.
This isn't over - not by a long shot. They are already talking bout floating this bill later once the heat is off, or it showing up later under an even cuter acronym (Freedom Respecting Every Action and Knowledge). And our Supreme Court just declared that stuff out of copyright can regrow its copyright (though not necessarily under the original owners). There's going to be a lot more of this going on as we go forward. But for the moment, this has to go down as a win.
Well actually he’s just unveiled what sounded to me like a damn good plan today and let’s just say if he’s not World Leader in twenty years or so he’ll probably be something else rich and important so I’m not complaining. Mr F’s plan is as follows:

No, I don't think so, because I don't think that Painer requires creativity for photographic copyright. Rather, it requires (a) that the subject matter of a photograph leaves scope for “sufficient formative freedom”, and (b) that the photographer exploit that freedom so as to leave his “mark” on the resulting work (ie, the photograph). (And it held that in the case of a photographic portrait, there is sufficient formative freedom, and thus the possibility of copyright, as "the photographer can determine, among other things, the angle, the position and the facial expression of the person portrayed, the background, the sharpness, and the light/lighting.") In my view this is perfectly consistent with the UK approach as adopted in Antiquesportfolio.com, where the court held that UK copyright will always subsist in a photograph of a single, static non-spherical 3-d object (eg, antiques) on the basis of the judgement involved in positioning the object, determining the angle at which it is to be taken, and determining the lighting and focus.

The Bruery's 3 French Hens, a Belgian Dark Ale, was very good. The Bruery would be a nice addition to KC. Duchesse de Bourgnonne was a nice sour beer and one of the few I got seconds on. I really loved Voodoo Love Child, it had a great raspberry flavor. I may have been a bit selfish with it as I carried the bottle around and had at least 2 glasses of it. Fantome Choklat was the disappointment of the evening, I thought it smelled like a St. Pauli Girl initially, but when Yeti said it smelled like Worlds of Fun, I had to concur. It didn't taste much better than either of those 2 smells. I really liked the Dogfish Head Sah'tea which Paul A. Ner has described as a gingerry Tank 7. Again, I have to concur. It was really good to me, several people felt the opposite. I think your judgment of Sah'tea would have to depend on your stance on ginger (the root, not the people, I think we can all agree that gingers are the devil's people). Pliny the Elder was indeed sublime.

During the Yom Kippur war (1973) the miracle on Golan Heights was discussed a lot, where the sudden and mysterious wind blew away the sand and exposed the land mines. 1973 war was a surprise attack by Arab states (Egypt, Syria and Jordan) to avenge the 1967 preemptive strike by Israel, where Israel had capture Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, West Bank and Golan Heights.
The youngest one, Sarah, couldn’t ride on the bigger swings yet. She had to sit in the toddler seats, which always struck Vincent as resembling a giant rubber diaper. It was safer, anyhow. Unless Sarah could pull herself out of the seat, there was no danger of her falling. Angel on the other hand, flew like the wind and loved to swing to the point of danger. She was his girl.
"Before you come in, the teacher in the hall will ask each of you, one by one, if you're ready. If you feel too wiggly, that's okay," we said. "You can step out of the line and get all your jumpies out, have another sip of water, and then try getting ready again. You can join the circle when you're ready. But we hope you'll try very hard, because the stories are too special to miss a single word."
At that point we reached Cambridge and on the platform I bumped into a university colleague and we talked all the way to Kings Cross, so the thread was lost.

1. Accepting complimentary food and drinks from a restaurant is fairly common for a variety of reasons including birthdays, replacing another dish, extra long wait times, etc. However, I personally feel that one should never ask for complimentary food simply because he or she blogs or tweets. Stating "I am a blogger, writer, reviewer, and therefore I want free food and drink" is in poor form. Tweeting that you should receive free food, drinks, and other goods is just wrong in my opinion. This is how some restaurant owners might feel about asking for free food and drinks. Anyone can write a blog on the Internet. Having a blog doesn't make a person special or deserving of complimentary treatment. If you are respected and known for your writing and your opinions, the staff will recognize you and compensate you as they please. Keep in mind that individuals who are well-known for their influence in media all started out somewhere. Most of them pay for their meals despite what the public might think.

There was an excellent chicken farm on the premises, and Eskom offered electricity so the owners could obtain a contract with Rainbow Chicken.

I work Java on a few things. Then its time to set up for class. The class starts. Im not controlling Miley circling at all. I want it to be her choice that she stops this. Oh, I forgot to tell you this. Yesterday I took a lesson from Meagan. It was at someone's house and only a couple of dogs. Miley only circled one time. WhooHoo , I was so excited. Now back to class. It was our turn to run. There was a dogwalk, tunnel discrimination and Miley took the wrong one. So I brought her back to try again and circling started. It lasted at least 3 minutes. I just stood there waiting her out( feeling bad about wasting every ones time). She just kept circling with no change is speed. It felt like forever. She has never lasted this long without stopping. She finally stops. Im not sure how to reward. Give her treats or start running agility again. I chose to run. Then she jumps the DW contact. I stop. She circles. But this time it lasted about 1/2 the time then the first circling event. I did reward with food this time. People commented that they have never seen her do this. They probably just hadnt seen it to this extent. I normally would have called her to my side to break the circling so thats why they didnt realize how big a problem this is for me. But she needs to chose not to do this without me calling her.

I'm presently very excited and very nervous about this coming Thursday. The Third Thursday celebration in downtown Pittsfield, Mass., will serve as both the culmination of almost three years of work (if you can call it that) as well as the springboard to future celebrations of the legacy of papermaking in the Upper Housatonic National Heritage Area.
Judyann McNamara, a Canadian homeopath, director of the Montreal College of Classical Homeopathy, and former physicist has said this of the report: “Circumstances have never been as opportune as now, in the quantum era for homeopathy to come to full acceptance by western medicine. The burgeoning new field of scientific research emerging from the convergence of nanoscience, biotechnology and quantum physics is paving the way for biologists to be able to understand the level at which homeopathy induces healing responses.”
I took a test last week to be a 2010 Census worker. It's a part time temp job to help with the national census that officially takes place next year. But, there is a lot of work to do to get ready for it - verify addresses, send out flyers and questionnaires. It won't make me rich, but it will give us a little extra if I get the job.

Kings, queens, nobles, evil henchmen, stereotypical simpletons, villagers and poor, beautiful and virtuous young girls rub shoulders in Pantoland.

As tradition demands our Dame is a stubbly chinned bloke.
In her 1935 New York Times’s review of the novel, Irvin wrote that when Carr created “an ingenious plot, a thoroughly ‘creepy’ atmosphere and a really likeable investigator,” he produced “an uncommonly successful thriller, which will keep the reader’s hair standing happily on end until the last page is reached.”

This film is all about glory, legends, cynical politics, big promises that kind of ambiguously follow through, and, of course, crowd control. So it's a lot like Webber's other PPCC favorite, Jesus Christ Superstar. As in JCS, the mob - amorphous, impatient, demanding and, above all, LOUD - is more than spectator. It is the important third character, getting in the way between the Father and Son, between Juan and Eva. If we were Žižek, we'd say it was the id to Juan's/God's superego and Eva's/Jesus' ego - the mob is unmanageable, impulsive, dangerous and hypnotic. It is the ugly, scary, Dionysian part of being human.
I'm standing in the middle of a yard in the suburbs. The sky is lightly spotted with fluffy clouds. Their wispy whiteness poofing out of the blue background. I feel a warmth come from my chest. This sensation is very familiar, although I don't remember ever having it before. In a few hearbeats, I figure out that this is the secret to flying. The warmth and tingling I feel eminating from within my chest is belief. A belief that encompasses my whole soul to the point of raising me from the earth's crust. As I ascend, I become very excited and tell myself aloud,
Good food shared with family all together... such a gift for us all.

I've purchased the ingredients for my annual "Sherpa Porter," a Robust Porter that I keep tweaking the recipe on, every year. This year, I've tweaked it a lot, and I'm interested in the result. I'm going to shoot for brewing it this Sunday; it's the only chance I'll have for 3 weeks.
Decent or not I'm here in California thinking of George and just wanting to rid my head of him. For the record, he's a great guy and it's not that I think he's the scum of the earth, just disappointed of actions took or not taken. Let it also be known that, yes, we had only been on 4 or so dates and no, I'm not crazy and saying I lost the love of my life. I'm just a slightly more deflated-balloon (think Winnie the Pooh when he goes honey hunting) because not only did I feel we had a possibility but also that it was ended so passively, presumably meant to only keep me guessing (Will he call today? Maybe that email is from him? Yes this sounds pathetic but you've all done it too!) until three weeks go by and I must guess that yes, he's either been eaten alive by one of those rabid raccoons running around central park or, I probably won't see him again. I also just can't stand , and I'm talking can't stand like you hate the the mean girls who tease your new bracelet in High School, the way that this inevitably makes me a drop more cautious, a drop less trusting and a spoonful more weary. I like my optimism verymuchthankyou and it's frustrated when someone comes along and messes with the whole layout.
I don’t know what to say to that. I have always been so stubborn that I have not been able to stay. Even when I had no place to land, I always jumped. I did that in music, cars, electronics jobs, and even publishing. It’s always worked. By worked, I mean I have always been able to find a new and better direction.
You know now that this game, if it can be called that, is on another level (to use that tired cliche for once when it actually fits).

The scene where a hobo is confronted by a paddy wagon full of garishly made-up prostitutes was like watching the inner workings of my own perverted mind (I was particularly fond of Julie McQuain's stellar work as "Receptive Whore in Van"); and the many shots of Jane Arakawa and her yummy stems walking across the junkyard grounds were a sensuous tonic in the face of all the foulness that surrounded her.

According to Richard Gottlieb, MSW and Diplomate with a capital D, last year at the Empathic Therapy Conference Dr. Peter Breggin said, “If you haven’t been fired at least once, you’re not doing your job.”
As for ‘petty’… well, we’ll return to that in a moment.
I was devastated as I had no real support. And the only professor with a kind heart was the life drawing teacher. But I didn't take from him and didn't know him. I had all the life drawing I needed already when I got there. He heard from one of the grad students what happened and tried to help but it was too late..I was undone.

Well how was that for a run on sentence! Ha! Well day turned to night and we were ready to hit the town after some balcony photo shoots and champagne of course . We were having a great time at the bar waiting for our table when we met this couple. They seemed normal at first until they just about propositioned ALL of us for a 6-way gross dinner continued in a normal fashion, drinking , laughing, singing happy birthday, walking to the 7-11 buying 40s and smart food popcorn and tucking ourselves in back at the hotel.

There are plenty of ways to dress down items in your wardrobe that you might currently consider to be off-limits for daily wear. Why not try pulling them out and giving them the airing they deserve? A mini top hat might be crossing the line for your average daytime office setting, but I've toned down ruffles, sequins, dominatrix boots, and even a Derby-worthy hat at work. Pair a sexy top with a boxy blazer and a pair of jeans; wear a slinky dress with a soft cardigan, chunky scarf, and boots; but don't let your best items languish in your closet because you don't think you have anything dressy enough to wear them to. Here are a few tools that you probably already have at your disposal to help you pull off those 'special' items in your daily wear:
All in all, a nice meal in a classic joint, with a fab deal that we wouldn't have been able to afford outside of dineLA.

Personally, I find it useful to keep in mind that no one is perfect and that every individual has issues to deal with. Another suggestion is to think of a time when you may have caused harm to someone else. Learning to accept people’s shortcomings and understanding that the majority of people in the world are innately good can help as well.

This brings me to the fascinating article in the New York Times Sunday magazine by Ethan Watters earlier this week. In “The Americanization of Mental Illness,” Watters looks at the export of not just American medical treatments for mental illness, but also the symptoms as US and European psychologists, medical professionals and pharmaceutical industries make their science and products available around the world. According to Watters’ article, research has long shown that “people with schizophrenia in developing countries appear to fare better over time than those living in industrialized nations.” An anthropologist named Juli McGruder from the University of Puget Sound looked into this question in her study of families of schizophrenics in Zanzabar who frequently believed their family member was possessed by spirits. This belief prompted them to do certain things to appease the spirits, so that the patients were “coaxed with food, feted with song and dance” all of which, it seemed, led to a better result in the long term for these patients than for their American counterparts, who are believed to have a chemical imbalance and whose families try to help them take full responsibility for themselves. Find time to read the whole article.
Hockey is king at this school. The men’s team offers students the opportunity to root for a team that has the chance to compete for a national championship every year, against legitimate rivals in a prestigious division. This opposed to a basketball team competing in a division with almost no name recognition, playing teams from schools that fans aren’t usually familiar with.

The Creative Intersection: The first question that springs to mind is what is it like now that Rachel (Jensen) is leaving the band?
As much potential as a player may have coming out of the draft , you never want the player to be satisfied with where they are at. This is where coaching comes in. If a team with poor coaching drafts a player with unlimited ability, that player will never reach their full potential. The amount of work we put into coaching and raising up our students matters!
Ollie’s mother began racing round the console too, pulling levers, and pushing buttons. But Ollie went on watching Amy, who was going through the whole hopping about, mouthing at the screen routine all over again. This time, she had some new hand movements. Ollie blinked; they looked familiar. He screwed his face up to look more closely, because screwing your face up obviously made it easier to see – ‘yes, banana,’ and ‘no alive – dead!’ What? Bananas? Dead bananas? Amy was waving again. Well, frantic flapping, more like. This time he thought she made the words ‘Remember dead banana’. Ollie made the same words back, and Amy nearly took off with excitement. Boy, that girl could jump, Ollie thought. He made the words again, just to see the effect, and he wasn’t disappointed. Amy was leaping up and down and throwing her arms around, so that the Ood sitting nearby had to shift out of the way. ‘Doctor,’ she signed; gripping her wrist as though she were taking her own pulse, and popping her eyes so wide, Ollie thought they might explode.
The barcode scanner application on Android allows you to compare prices by scanning the barcode with your phone camera but in my experience this shows me alternate prices on Google and there’s little information on whether these boxes of lager are on multibuy. Multibuy is when a box of beer may be £14, but 2 boxes are £15. I think I can see a little project if those nice chaps at My Supermaket are willing to send me documentation on their web services.

There is something very gruesome, very startling, very intense in this communion. Something that brings a person instantly to reviling offense or broken humility. The transparency of the sacrifice, the genuineness of the love . . will either overwhelms to spiteful wrath that anyone would even offer such a gift as his own flesh and blood to drink . . . or overwhelms with breathtaking sorrow that such a gift was necessary and unending joy that such a gift was given.
Christmas is tomorrow and I couldn't be happier. All four of my daughters, my brother and sister-in-law, two of Jen's kids, and her sister and mother will all be at my house for dinner tonight. Jen and I no doubt will be going nuts with all the company, yet, neither of us would have it any other way.

The bride looks beautiful. She is stunning and my wish for her tomorrow is that she takes a deep breath, and remembers to take it all in because tomorrow is about her (and the groom of course - but he has made a point of NOT reading my blog so this is all about the lovely Lauren), but she has wanted this wedding for so long, and my wish for her is that she enjoys every second of it.
If the police ask for the password to your electronic device, you can politely refuse to provide it and ask to speak to your lawyer. Every arrest situation is different, and you will need an attorney to help you sort through your particular circumstance. Note that just because the police cannot compel you to give up your password, that doesn’t mean that they can’t pressure you. The police may detain you and you may go to jail rather than being immediately released if they think you’re refusing to be cooperative. You will need to decide whether to comply.

As for the comping parts I think this could have been more varied rhythmically. I also have insufficient understanding of chord voicing techniques. I’ve been trying to address this during my piano lessons but this is a lengthy process for me and will probably take me months if not years to make a considerable improvement.

Good Morning to all of you out there! Remember this post where I talked about the Blogger Discount Program for Ecolissa.com... Well my clothes came in yesterday!! I practically ripped the box open thats how excited I was! I couldn't wait to try on the clothing I had purchased!
As you've probably noticed, I haven't had much time to post recently. I really hate not being able to update regularly because I feel bad leaving my readers hanging and I miss writing and my mom calls me every day and says, "Didn't you used to have a blog or something? Didn't it used to brighten my days? BECAUSE NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE FOR." She's so subtle.
The last few weeks have been very fairly eventful and painful for me, but I'll refrain from writing about all the gory details – partly because I have enough integrity not to invade other people’s privacy and partly because I have a sense of shame and want to preserve some semblance of personal dignity.

I discovered that I was in the midst of creating a situation of resentfulness between Mister and I. After a week, I had been able to understand the real issue, and was ready to discuss it with Mister. He was shocked to find out that I felt I had been in trouble. This particular response of mine is so foreign to him, that he does not recognize it. He would never treat his own adult children that way, so he has no concept of any adult feeling like they are in “trouble”.
College was the logical next step. College was the expected next step. In my middle-American world, college is a necessary step. The number of high school students continuing their educations at universities and colleges across the country has grown significantly with the current generation. Yes, college enrollment has been on a steady increase for some time now, but the current attendees took the trend to a new level. Some people continue on the path of education because they genuinely enjoy learning and acquiring knowledge. Some students attend college for the simple reason that “it comes after high school.” Many other reasons exist that run the gambit that drive the 18-23 year old American demographic into the halls of educational institutions, despite rising prices and “questionable academics”. The big problem seems to crop up after “real life” approaches like a semi-truck with graduation. Where are you supposed to go afterward?

Amgen Tour of California hits Santa Cruz, Monday, May 14, 2012
Eating with others I always worry about the cutlery; will I know which fork to use? I once went to a wedding and accidentally stole the brides fork. I had never met the bride before, nor had such a fancy meal. I get obsessively angry about table manners. My brother used to eat with his mouth open in a deliberate attempt to wind me up. It worked, if I have to eat with someone who chews with their mouth open they must have thick skin and therefore not notice the murderous glances I throw them across the table.

The morning after the night before (which is another blog altogether) we sneaked out of Dave's uncle's house (where we had sneaked in at 1am when everyone was in bed), leaving behind only an apologetic bottle of Vitesse Noir on the table as evidence that we had actually been there.

‘Vault’, published earlier this year by Salt under its Modern Fiction wing, edited by Nicholas Royle, is an anti-novel. What IS an anti-novel? Was this a clever device intended to catch the eye, or was it really something working against what we expect when we read a novel? I think that yes, on one level it really is an anti-novel. It works like this. The main character of this novel, (for it is one, and a clever one) steps out of the realm of fiction, clothes himself in fact, and thus clothed, peers back into the unfolding narrative as the facts of his life are shaken and embroidered by the novelist. What novelist? Not this one – not David Rose – but another character, a novelist we never meet, a novelist who is repeatedly taken to task by the ‘real’ main character for playing fast and loose with a life that needs no embroidering.
I love her type choices and I'm amazed at the amount of detail and definition she can get from a piece of chalk! As you can see in these time-lapse films she works completely freehand, sketching and re-sketching to get the desired design (see below).

Every issue is a women’s issue and no issue is a women’s issue alone. The fight for fair wages for the woman worker blends into the struggle against imperialism. The struggle for the dignity of dalit women is an integral part of the struggles to annihilate caste and smash feudalism. The rape and murder of Manorama Devi in Manipur, the mass rape in Kunan Poshpora in Kashmir by the Indian army, the attack on countless adivasi women in central and eastern India by the state forces or the notorious Salwa Judum demonstrates the particular vulnerability of women to all forms of attacks, discrimination and deprivation. The fight for women’s rights can only be fought with the collective strength of struggles waged against all forms of oppression, and not in isolation. This has been the lesson of the students’ movement of our campus, as well as the revolutionary women’s movement of this country exemplified by mass organisations like Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan of Bastar, Nari Mukti Sangh of Bihar-Jharkhand or nari Ijjat Bachao Samiti of Jangal Mahal. To strengthen and expand the scope of GSCASH and to revive the women’s movement in this campus, we must build bridges between movements that are being fought for the democratization of education and of the campus at large.
Psalm 91 The Message
Before Zechariah 1, which is the second last appearance of the angel of the Lord in the OT (the last appearance is in Zechariah 3), the angel of the Lord appears 11 other times, and as I examined all his appearances in the Old Testament I noticed a whole load of strange details when he appears:

Later that evening, I made the mistake of allowing him to be circumcised. He wouldn't nurse after that. I thought, he knew I didn't want him earlier when I refused to nurse him and now I let them hurt him, so he no longer wants me. I cried again, but this time I knew why I was crying. After an hour of sheer heartbreak, I tried nursing him again, and after he got on with a very painful latch, I decided I wasn't going to be sad, because I didn't want people thinking I was weak and looking for pity. There are women in the world being beat by their husbands, raped, and I am not going to let myself be selfish enough to wallow in any grief over what happened to me.

And needless to say, there is zero evidence that we are prepared to seriously address the problem of global warming sufficiently enough to actually achieve the 2-degree goal. This is because we are a short-sighted, greedy, and not-quite-intelligent-enough species, and the world we bequeath to future generations will be severely damaged as a result. Very likely we will go down in history as a generation of obnoxious assholes who were too enthralled with our SUVs and plastic tchotchkes to make even the most minimally adequate moral calculations about our actions.

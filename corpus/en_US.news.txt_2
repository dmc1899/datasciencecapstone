Moviegoers — young (the summer staple) and old (increasingly coming back to the five-and-dime, Jimmy Dean…) — want a constant flow.

We are a totally wired nation of want it all, all the timers.

Romney's fellow Latter-day Saints, moreover, can also make a positive difference at the ballot box.

This is a highly literate drama (Hampton wrote the screenplay) with a distinguished cast that includes Michael Fassbender as Jung, Viggo Mortensen as Freud and Keira Knightley as Spielrein. Cronenberg, not known for making decorous films for tea-sipping academics, plunges us immediately into the grotesqueries of Spielrein's hysteria.

She grunts and stammers and flails in a manner that doesn't so much invoke someone in the throes of mental illness as an actor laying it out there for award season.

If Al Sharpton doesn't like what we're doing, he can go to Iran and become a citizen and vote.

Saying this brings no pleasure. Of all the recent comic-book transplants to the big screen, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker has been the most likable, quirky and reliably human, even when he's squirting web-juice from his hands as the semi-superhuman Spider-Man. And the series has gained in grace from Peter's fraught love for Kirsten Dunst's winsome and endearing Mary Jane Watson. Yet the third go-round conventionalizes its hero by throwing him into repetitive struggles with his dark side. (Clothes and the man make each other here, since the black symbiotic substance that's responsible for his darkness and alarming arrogance turns his costume from red and blue to jet black.) And the script traps him and M.J. in a domestic struggle that's straight out of "A Star Is Born."

The mood turns more somber as we near Khao Lak, one of the areas hit hardest by the Dec. 26, 2004 tsunami. Reminders of that lethal wave still remain. One hotel looks struck by a tornado, its wall-less rooms filled with debris. A police boat remains where the receding water left it, perhaps a mile inland, to serve as a memorial to those who died. Joom lost a friend on a coastal island, she tells us softly, and Keam, his crocodile-smile fading for the first time today, recalls how he frantically ushered guests upstairs to safety at the resort where he worked at the time, returning twice to the lobby before being forced to swim for his life.

(On how he evaluates a quarterback if linemen are missing blocks and receivers aren't doing their job)- "You bring up a very, very good point. I think when you're evaluating, every coach grades every player on every play. Then they come in and they meet and I'm not in those meetings. It's the way I use to do it and I'm sure Pat does it the same way. Then the head coach in essence is his own offensive coordinator. He's part of that. You look at the film and then you get the grades from your assistants. Mark Whipple as an example says Colt executed properly on this play, but the play wasn't successful, why wasn't it if it was a pass? Well, because he was pressured, this guy missed his block, this guy dropped the ball and then they get a grade. You get a grade and the point being as a coaching staff you must be brutally honest as to what happened and why it happened. You can't protect your player, you can't protect in your own mind yourself because all of a sudden if your player keeps being the guy that messes up then you're on thin ice, you can't do that. You just have to honest, that's the only way you have any chance of fixing anything and I think our guys do a good job of that. There's a pretty veteran presence in that offensive room. They will know if it's a quarterback error, what happened, did he do the best anyone could do, they'll know those things so while on the surface it might seem it might be a little bit tricky, it's not that tricky, they'll know."

He's as tough-talking as Charles de Gaulle and, like the cantankerous general who ruled France four decades ago, Nicolas Sarkozy is determined to save France from its single biggest enemy: the French. And this is just the man who can pull it off. Currently minister of the interior under President Jacques Chirac, the 51-year-old Sarkozy is already considered the centrist UMP party's leading presidential candidate in April's French national elections. He is no favorite of incumbent Chirac (their relations are often as frosty as frozen foie gras). Yet while Chirac's popularity steadily plummets, Sarkozy's is on the rise. Here's why: Sarkozy comes bearing a tough-love message for his people that's long overdue: Arrogant France has fallen behind. Between lack of economic initiative, ravenous welfare costs and immigration woes, this once powerful nation has become a European sick man. If the country wants to drag itself out of those doldrums, Sarkozy says, it's going to have to stop resting on its aging laurels. It must radically reform its perverse handout economy - where people work only 35 hours a week - and start to puts its nose to the grindstone. What's more, in order to win the war on global terrorism, he insists, France has to join hands with its allies - not throw diplomatic tacks in their path. And how's this for a breath of fresh air? Unlike all other French leaders of the last 50 years, Sarkozy genuinely admires America and Americans. He made that loud and clear when he visited the U.

Smoke House: This restaurant has been going strong since it was built at the end of World War II, welcoming an industry crowd from nearbyWarner Bros. studios — in the old days, actors in cowboy and Indian costumes. These days the crowd isn't quite so colorful, but the food is just the same — the famous Smoke House garlic bread, jumbo shrimp cocktail, artichoke dip and barbecued baby-back ribs. If you come in early, 4 to 6 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays and 3 to 5 p.m. Sundays, everything on the menu is 25% off.
Heritage: Yamauchi's parents, who had been living in Gardena, were sent to a Japanese American internment camp in Arkansas during World War II. Yamauchi was born shortly after they were released.
I also sit on the Marcellus Shale Run, and I am in negotiations to sell drilling rights. This is a very lucrative deal, and before I do it I will relocate to a more tax-friendly state. This is a financial decision any smart person would make, the same type of decisions Mitt Romney made in the public sector.
For example, as faculty and students in the Health and Human Rights Clinic at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, we represent a client who is legally blind and whose wife is disabled. On paper, they do not present as one of the 53 million Americans who are without health insurance, since they qualify for the Medicare and Medicaid government programs. But Indiana officials have erected a daunting barrier between them and any possible Medicaid support for the prescriptions they need to fill. Our state's regulations require this couple to first "spend down" their income to well below subsistence level by incurring several hundred dollars each month in medical bills. When they cannot do that, which is often, they do not get Medicaid help and must go without the care their doctor has prescribed. The consequences of not taking the medication they cannot afford include severe pain, swelling and complications that have on occasion forced them to be hospitalized.
But during a speech Saturday in Calgary, Palin acknowledged the irony of her family using medical care in Canada decades ago.
øIn fact, Brown was cut by the Cardinals earlier this year, though he was re-signed by the team a few days later to a five-year, $30million contract, of which $8 million is guaranteed.
The initial allegation was that the teacher sexually abused the De Smet student at the suspect's Creve Coeur residence.
The demand for payback regarding personal-care services is the federal government’s most recent claim against the state’s Medicaid program. In November, the federal health department’s inspector general’s office released another audit saying New Jersey may have improperly billed $35 million for mental health services since 2005.
The notorious London weather may have left us soggy and shivering per usual, but the fall 2010 fashion shows provided plenty of cozy trends in which to decadently wrap ourselves. While traditional English heritage brands such as Burberry and Aquascutum produced crowd-pleasing, squeal-worthy collections, it was burgeoning young designers who reminded us why London remains the sartorial Mecca for fresh talent.
The cases show how millions of advertising and marketing dollars can be rendered powerless when a company's product is swept into a big news story. Hostess Brands Inc., which owns Twinkies, says it does not have any archival information on how it handled the popularization of the term "the Twinkie defense." The phrase was used derisively by the media during the trial of Dan White, who fatally shot San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978. White's lawyers cited his poor eating habits as a sign of his depressed state.
State law requires the cameras to be located in school zones.

But no. In that moment when the functionary at BMW offered me any 3-series I wanted, I succumbed to maximalism. Maximalism is the mostly male mind-set that assumes "more" is better. Spare me your relativism on matters of weight/price/performance/fuel economy. I will not measure out my life in coffee spoons. I want wider tires, bigger brakes, harder suspension, faster windshield wipers. I want the El Presidente, the Venti, the subzero sleeping bag, the full-frame CMOS, the triple-core processor. This is straight out of Thorstein Veblen, the University of Chicago economist who coined the phrase "invidious comparison."

"If anything, it promotes a type of empty competitiveness among users," observed one of my grad students. Another was even more skeptical. "These days, I'm sort of craving finite visual adventures — like, reading a magazine and when I'm done, it's done," she noted. "The endless possibilities of clicking and clicking on sites like Pinterest is disheartening to me sometimes."
In a perfect world, we’d all eat the meat of grass-fed cattle raised within a 20-mile radius of our homes. In the real world, most of us will continue to eat mass-produced commodities that we don’t want to know too much about.

If the application is approved, Missouri will move toward one accountability system. Right now, districts are held to No Child Left Behind benchmarks, as well as measures in the state's annual performance report. It leads to confusion when some districts are labeled as failing under No Child Left Behind but considered a top performer by the state. That has happened with the Parkway School District, for example.

With Apple in, Dow would have set record long ago
Janzen doesn't really have a case - he's ranked No. 602 in the world and without a win since his long-ago triumph at Olympic. Els, at No. 63 in the rankings, still could earn a spot on his own by climbing into the top 60.
Solis said, “We need to be able to grow our own pipeline” of scientists and engineers.

Read in the library? Not my child, the one whom I've empowered with anatomy lessons from a young age so she would never call all private parts "down there." We Sokols are mature, we communicate. We certainly do not hide behind books when the rest of the fifth grade is learning how to apply deodorant.
The boat's crew used our absence to prepare a Polynesian-style lunch of grilled chicken and fish, rice, mango juice, corn and sweetbread cake. It was a refreshing change from the French food served in most of Rangi's hotel restaurants. We ate at tables shaded by coconut palms, their fronds rustling in the breeze. Cumulus clouds drifted across a blue sky, and frigate birds coasted overhead on currents of air. It was a perfect afternoon—almost. The problem? Being on an uninhabited island with a dozen people I didn't know.
Other than that, he said, "it's back to business as usual."
Citizens for Tax Choice argues that the measure puts an unfair burden on all township taxpayers for projects that will ultimately benefit only a small number of residents.
That's "The Adventures of Tintin" boiled down to its essence. Steven Spielberg's film, based on the popular comic books created by the Belgian artist Herg�, is a marvel to look at, taking full advantage of motion-capture and 3D technology, and a challenge to keep up with. In some ways it recalls Spielberg's Indiana Jones adventures, though more manic, if you can imagine such a thing.
Since the formation of these programs and sponsorships, we have helped attract and retain numerous talented and diverse professionals to our region despite a challenging economy. The list of RBC program alumni who have elected to stay in the St. Louis area is impressive and continues to grow. In fact, 67 percent of college students who participated in the 2008-2009 RBC Mentor Network opted to begin their professional careers in the region. They can be found at Boeing, Edward Jones, Anheuser-Busch/InBev, Save-A-Lot, Monsanto, Savvis and many other leading St. Louis-area companies. In addition, through a targeted collaboration with Washington University, we were able to increase the retention of business school graduates by 6 percent in one year.

Along the way, English mingles with stock characters on loan from the time-tested Bond formula. Kate (Rosamund Pike) is the beautiful, brainy female spy who's tough, sensitive, and slowly falling for our hero. Eager but untested rookie agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) can't understand why he's so much smarter than his supposed mentor. And then there's English's chief rival, Ambrose, the near-perfect spy played by handsome Dominic West (who can't stop smirking, probably because he's thinking of the yacht he'll purchase using his "English" paycheck).
Jones says she continues placing low-wage temps with companies that don't follow through with permanent hiring. Instead, Jones said, "Employers are utilizing temp staffing much longer than in the past. Unfortunately what we see is a volume of the work on the lower pay scales, in entry-level manufacturing but not at the management level."

Hey, Phil: The media are allowed to view only the first 30 minutes of practice. There's no real chance to see much of Lewis in that time.

Mahler doesn’t make use of all of these musicians until the final movement, a vast setting of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock’s “Die Auferstehung” (The Resurrection).

One of London's most sought-after portrait photographers is one of its most unlikely: the Swiss-born Frederic Aranda, who wanted to be a rabbi as a child and then studied Japanese at Oxford University.

Mizzou football apparently has updated the depth chart it will take into the summer and ultimately fall camp, but coach Gary Pinkel said Tuesday morning during the Big 12 spring football teleconference that he didn't want to comment publicly until he was certain his entire staff and players themselves were aware of where all stand.
I've asked Will about his penchant for stripping, and he really doesn't have an answer. However, he credits being raised in Irvine for his particular brand of comedy.

This year, as one of only three seniors on Glencoe's team that also won the Pacific Conference title last year, Van Roekel has emerged as not only an elite player but a team leader.

Hatcher sells 130,000 cases each year, 120,000 under the A to Z label. Cheryl Francis, Sam Tannahill and Bill and Debra Hatcher started the winery in 2002 by buying 2,600 cases - “most of it $40 bottles of wine that there was no market for,” Hatcher notes - and blending it into a much cheaper, and marketable, varietal.

Memories of Machebeuf's great run in Colorado's girls high school basketball could fade away. The school has moved to the Lowry Community in east central Denver. The 74-game winning streak has been replaced as the longest in Colorado High School basketball by McClave's 75. But it's still one better than the boys record of 73 by Ridgway. The members of the three teams haven't gathered in a reunion and see one another infrequently.

In a statement, the company said it is completing a transition started by former owner Vornado Realty Trust and is helping the apparel tenants find nearby space.

Barry Abrams, a racehorse trainer in Southern California for three decades, said he is deeply troubled by every death but that it is unrealistic to think that fatalities can be eliminated.

By the time the camps conclude, Fewell hopes the NFL’s lockout is settled and that he’ll be able to coordinate the Giants’ defense again. The group will be bolstered by the additions of first-round cornerback Prince Amukamara and second-round defensive tackle Marvin Austin.

WOODBURY — Imagine walking into a Victoria’s Secret in the early 1800s.

She restlessly moves from one idea to another — scattered throughout are meager summations of the efforts of major theologians (Martin Buber and Paul Tillich among them) to understand the divine reality. She never seems to stop long enough to live with a particular view of God. Let's adopt her cliché of a breakup with God for a moment: It takes a long time and many shared experiences to build a deep understanding of one's beloved. Often it has little to do with words — but there's too much talk here, too much chatter about competing viewpoints.

Second, we’ve done some research to respond productively to your item 1). ORS 382.310(1)(a) states that the County is responsible to “maintain, keep in good condition and repair and operate” the Willamette River bridges located within the City of Portland. As we have discussed already, that applies whether or not the City or County owns the bridge itself. Therefore, the first step in any transfer is a change to ORS that reverts control of the bridges to the City. On our end, we would also need to figure out how to maintain and operate the bridges we have outside the City, i.e. the Sauvie Island Bridge, bridges in East Multnomah County. In short, because of the work that needs to be done to ensure a smooth transfer and keep the Sellwood bridge process online, transferring the bridges prior to this agreement is out of the question. If “during” means at some point over the term of this IGA, that seems more reasonable and I suspect we’d be able to get language we can all agree on.
five-game home stand, opening the stretch with a 3-0 win over Chicago on Tuesday. The team is 7-7 overall, 1-0 under new coach Ken Hitchcock.

A great star at Miami of Ohio 10 years ago, he has been the ideal teammate this season, hitting 3s, rebounding, pointing to assist-makers, and high-fiving everyone. That is the big picture.

The momentum really goes over to their side, and it's tough to fight back."
Do crows and ravens, notorious nest predators, take a toll on smaller urban birds? That's hard to pin down. "Any evidence of raiding nests is purely anecdotal," Murphy said.

Why is Medicare expensive? Simply, health care for seniors will always cost more than that of healthier, younger Americans. And costs are rising in every health care system around the world, not just Medicare. The United States is doubly cursed because our costs are rising faster and are already twice as expensive as other countries. Though hard to believe, Medicare is a leader in fighting cost increases. Private insurance industry costs are rising nearly twice as fast as those of Medicare. And when it comes to administrative expenses, private insurance is 10 times higher than Medicare. In fact, if the single payer financing of Medicare were applied to citizens of all ages, we would save $350 billion annually, more than enough to provide comprehensive health care to every American.

Whether because it lies in the shadow of Mexico City, or because so little tourism information is available in (comprehensible) English, or for some other mysterious reason, foreign tourists tend to overlook Puebla in droves.

Where is the next Al Goldis, who was key to the jackpot of talent the Sox developed in the early '90s (e.g., Thomas, Fernandez, McDowell, Ventura -- even Alvarez through the Himes trade). Now that was a farm system. -- M. Peregrine; Glencoe

To orient ourselves, we took a three-hour "Local's Life" bicycle tour with La Bicicleta Verde tour company. Best decision ever. We stopped our cruiser bikes at all of the major attractions such as the Central Seafood Market, Plaza de Armas and the Fine Arts Museum, which was badly damaged by last year's 8.8 magnitude earthquake.

The previous draft of history was correct: The anticommunists were right, and Hellman was profoundly, inexcusably wrong.

Given all the ways that individuals and businesses can taint their images, or have them ruined by others, crisis management is probably a secure career. It's certainly gotten more challenging since social media offered instant global access to embarrassments.
"The point of this is visibility," said St. Louis police Capt. Joseph Spiess, who pitched the plan Wednesday to the Board of Police Commissioners. "The whole point of this program is to address our nuisance properties."

They also should prioritize Chiefs cornerback Brandon Carr, who would be an exceptional starter; inside linebacker Dan Connor, who played for Fox with the Panthers; cornerback William Middleton and safety Dwight Lowery, who played for Jack Del Rio with the Jaguars; inside linebacker Stephen Tulloch, late of the Lions; and defensive tackle Amobi Okoye, who was with the Bears.
"Blackjack is deteriorating severely because of corporate stupidity," said Al Rogers, Pi Yee's general manager and a semi-retired professional gambler. "They're going to kill off their own game unless they realize at some point you can't fool all the suckers all the time forever.

This is not the same dynamic, however, in which smaller, splintered groups clashed with management in the lower-level United Soccer Leagues almost as much as they did with opposing fans. Though still feisty, Seattle and Portland supporters' groups are much more integrated into and accountable to the clubs now that they're in MLS, tempering the rivalry.

"There's definitely a certain level of prestige that goes along with having a major deal. I know several artists that prefer the prestige; I personally prefer to be able to feed my family," she continued.
Reality is a more complicated thing. The nimble, productive, high-profit dynamo that Daniel Gross describes as America's new economic model is making plenty of people rich. Nevertheless, it is different from the old economy. It requires fewer workers. Those who are lucky enough to have jobs often do not have the benefits, job security and solid middle-class salaries that were more plentiful in the old economy. Older workers may never find a place in this new system. Young people with only a high school education can expect a life of underemployment. Those who have gone deep into debt to pay for a college education may spend years after graduation waiting tables or making lattes before they find a job that matches their skills.
BOSSIER CITY, La. -- Bossier City police got a Shreveport woman and the hatchet they say she used to chase and threatened two people after a road rage incident.
I can't think of any good reason to keep jacking up ATM fees, except good old-fashioned greed. But like overpriced telephones in hotel rooms, the days of charging excessive fees to use a money-machine are coming to an end. Various forms of cashless payment systems, including the kind that use cellphones and other wireless devices, are quickly replacing paper money as the preferred method of settling up with a merchant.

Ireland has more legends than it has lochs, and another is that the first Irish coffee was made with a shot of Tullamore Dew (www.TullamoreDew.com). As Irish whiskies go, Tullamore Dew is milder and smoother than its kissin' the Blarney Stone cousins. Its color is paler than most, and the tasting notes brim with citrus, spice and butter. The soft flavor of charred oak gives it exceptional character that's easy to drink neat or on the rocks, and it's good for a first-time whiskey drinker.
Powell got off to the faster start but Gatlin pulled even and managed to get his head in front as they crossed the line.
Red-and-white signs advertising "China Aid" erected outside newly built schools and a billboard by the "China Technical Center" on the outskirts of Nuku'alofa are subtle political reminders of the Chinese financing and aid that for the time being Tonga can't do without.
øAll of the levels have lyrical, mood-enhancing music. Nice features for kids include an auto-cling aspect that makes it hard for the characters to fall off platforms and ledges. Also good are the frequent save points and, if you happen to fail within a level and are sent back to the last checkpoint, the game remembers the work you have accomplished. For example, if the porcupine just built a ladder before you fell into a void, it will still be there when you start again from the last checkpoint. This is a magical game with visuals that fill you with wonder.

øThe 462MB download for iOS and Android devices also adds updated character and vehicle models, a new mission replay and autosave function, and customizable controls. But using a virtual analog stick with your left thumb and pressing pretend buttons with your right thumb - without blocking your screen - can be a challenge for some. Shooting, especially, can be difficult to pull off with precision. Because of the added real estate, playing on a tablet should provide a better experience than on a smaller device.
Reasons for optimism: The Ducks return just two full-time starters, Asper at right tackle and York at left guard. But Weems, a right tackle, is a quasi returning starter given that he has 27 career games under his belt, including 11 last year with seven stars. All told, the Ducks projected starters, including Golpashin, have a combined 104 games of experience. Challenging Golpashin at right guard will be Cody, a versatile reserve who has appeared in 20 games. That level of experience at guard and tackle will come in handy with a virtual rookie expected to start at center. Armstrong, a sophomore, is the leading candidate to start there but redshirt freshman Hroniss Grasu also is in the mix. A wildcard that could play in a big way for Oregon is the return of center Hamani Stevens. He left the team for a two-year Mormon mission to the Philippines but is back and has participated in summer workouts. If he can shake off the rust of being absent for two seasons, Hamani could end up being the starter at center. Rivals.com ranked Hamani as the No. 2 center prospect in the country in 2008.
"It's a cool thing to be here with your mom or dad," Ochwat said of the optional event, which typically attracts about 200 students. "In middle school, you rarely will say 'cool' and 'parent' and 'school' in the same sentence."

And CSU did it with size deficiencies on many nights and with a roster that fluctuated among seven and 10 available players on any given night due to numerous injuries.

Word was, the big cheeses in the Sharks ownership wanted to concentrate primarily on hockey. And over the past 20 months, actions taken by the franchise would seem to confirm that premise.

The Lakers thought they had taken control of the series with a final-minute rally to win a tight Game 4, but the Nuggets have outplayed the third-seeded Lakers for long stretches of the series.

But Mr. Bo's opponents hope his former police chief, Wang Lijun—who led the Chongqing crime crackdown and was carted away by security agents after apparently looking for protection in a U.S. consulate in February—could provide incriminating evidence that could lead to a disciplinary or criminal investigation against Mr. Bo.

For younger families, the lure of buying long-term care insurance is that premiums are more reasonable than when they get older. The difficulty is that these same families often have a lot of demands on their money, such as retirement savings, disability insurance, an emergency fund, college tuition and life insurance. I wouldn't skimp on retirement savings to buy a long-term care policy.

Davone Bess, WR, Dolphins. Bess is easy to overlook in an offense that features Brandon Marshall and Reggie Bush.

Both the smoker and non-smoker start out on an expected even plane before they enter a business for service, that is, a means to pay for the service or product rendered.

Where "50/50" comes delightfully alive is in its ever more romantic encounters between Adam, who desperately needs a special someone to hold him together, and Katherine, who, given her pack-rat predilections and her pitiful inexperience, seems the least likely of Seattle's therapists to do so. Take a step back and you see that Ms. Kendrick is playing the familiar cliché of a wacko shrink, but this extraordinary comedienne never steps back for a moment.

Another night we ordered prime rib ($22.95), a huge slab of meat that was well worth the price, just about the only thing on the menu that I could imagine returning for.

Excerpt: This time around, the debate is spurred by the enormous amounts of cash suddenly tossed around by TV networks. And because head coaches rake in millions of dollars each year. And also — let’s not overlook this — because when guys like Terrelle Pryor are trading autographs and game-worn gear for tattoos and cash, we begin to wonder: Maybe it’s a dumb move, a signature for permanent body ink, but why can’t he trade on his name? Why shouldn’t LaMichael James and Darron Thomas and the Rodgers brothers get something for what they give on Saturdays? Haven’t they earned it? Who could possibly be against the idea?
When we students entered the classroom, the keys of the typewriters were covered, but there was a large picture of a typewriter keyboard on the front of the room.

Index fingers to the keys above and back again, and so on, finger after finger.

When it comes to the gift-giving part of the season, as KATU recently reported, "The basic idea is to give someone a gift only you can give them." You could give a loved one a book highlighting memories of times together or coupons offering your baking or driving services. The money saved by not giving people sweaters that they end up returning can go to things such as clean water programs in developing countries or area shelters. That is what Imago and other area churches are doing with the money they collect. If families adopt a version of this, they could avoid a lot of those gift cards entirely.

But she's become the topic du jour for "Housewives" fanatics after trailers for the second part of the reunion show suggest that Dina is no longer speaking to older sister, Caroline Manzo, the Mama Bear of the Garden State franchise who is now warring with fellow Housewife Teresa Giudice, also Dina's friend.

Things get more delicate in mainland Europe. The progress of nuclear is more likely to be halted in Turkey and Italy, owing to the awareness that it was an earthquake that caused the Fukushima disaster. Never mind that both have long-term current-account problems and no domestic resources, Istanbul has averaged one earthquake every 17 years for the past two millennia. That means any nuclear plant built in Turkey can expect to experience at least two quakes in its lifetime.

A: Arborvitae is not a recommended plant for the lower deserts. Back in the 1930s, they were planted by builders from California in flood-irrigated yards. Back then people were not of the mind-set to plant desert plants. Today, there are a few remnants. This is a high-maintenance plant and is highly vulnerable to spider mites -- especially if the plant is stressed by our hot, dry conditions. You will have to continually spray this tree to keep it in shape and water it frequently during the summer months. I would suggest planting a broad-leaved evergreen tree such as the Texas ebony instead.

My wife's Garlic-Marinated Grilled Hanger Steak ($25), one of several new dishes on the recently updated seasonal menu, is a unique cold-weather creation. Tasty slices of beef rest on a bed of roasted root vegetables bathed in a rich red-wine syrup flavored by fresh thyme. My only complaint was that the beef was not as tender as other hanger steaks I have had. I could chalk that up to it having been cooked past the medium-rare doneness requested.

Jamison also has allowed his heir apparent to succeed in a reserve role and to gain confidence -- usually against the opponent's reserves. Thompson is an impressive weak-side defender and an explosive leaper. He also possesses good basketball acumen, rarely making poor decisions. But Thompson, another Cav who doesn't create his own shot, would be exposed as a starter. He and Irving will get to play together soon enough. Coach Byron Scott is making the smart play by sticking with Jamison.

I sued Baltimore City last summer to stop what I perceived to be an illegal removal of trees. But this was prompted by secrecy and incompetence. We asked for a copy of the city's tree plan, from either the city or BRD, and got nothing.

And now, taxpayers will be paying for the replanting — which BRD was supposed to cover.

She loved the plant, and kept it near her bedside as she slipped into her last sleep. When my wife led Ruby's funeral a few days later, the wilting daffodil was the lone floral arrangement beside her casket.

Registered nursing, the occupation expected to add the most jobs -- 712,000 -- offers a bright spot, with mean annual wages of $67,720 in 2010.
The Blues' top line of David Backes, T.J. Oshie and David Perron has been responsible for defending Thornton's line in the series, and they have received much credit for the job they've done. But for Backes and Oshie, whose only three points of the series came in Game 2, some are wondering if they could be providing more offense and still do a solid job checking the Sharks.
Twins fans, meanwhile, have their own ideas about how to fix a team that owns baseball's worst record. They seemingly want to replace everyone in uniform, starting with the coaching staff. Losing incites anger, though, and Vavra realizes scrutiny is inevitable in tough times.
5. Car 54, Where Are You? (1994): Not that the old TV show with Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis and Joe E. Ross was a monument to quality, but the film with David Johansen and John C. McGinley brought actual physical pain. And guess who plays one of the female leads? Our dear Rosie O.
øLike Good Girl, much of Blown Away shows the influence of '80s music. "I think it's just stuff I gravitate toward," she says. She recalls producer Mark Bright adding an echo effect to her vocals on the title song. "That was a big thing with Def Leppard, all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it. So he would go to See You Again and throw a little bit in that. And I'd be like, 'I love that!' Mark would just notice when I would say, 'Turn that up! Make more of that happen!' And he would go off of what I seemed to like."
I also felt the movie also did not address the tumultuous nature of Katniss' and Peeta's relationship to the extent that the novel did, choosing to address the couple's fights only briefly. However, as soon as the two entered the arena of the Hunger Games, the film took a turn for the better. Not only did the cinematography become rawer and more shocking, the sound conveyed the drama of the upcoming events. Lawrence's acting improved tenfold, as the young actress proved her ability to illustrate the protagonist's grim determination found in the original text.
The Winsteads were well connected to Baltimore's urban planning community. Mr. Winstead, who now lives in North Roland Park, worked as a real estate developer and Mrs. Winstead was a secretary for the Greater Baltimore Committee. Mrs. Winstead enjoyed keeping up with commercial development in Baltimore, her son said.
East St. Louis, which returned three starters from a 23-9 team that advanced to the sectional finals, has won seven straight games -- including three in Southwestern Conference play -- since that defeat.
øThere is a cry among fans for the Sabres to make a major move, preferably to land a No. 1 center. This team could use a flag carrier up front. But that level of deal would not be easily accomplished because the Sabres are at the salary cap limit. Plus, there a handful of teams looking for premium offensive players and there are few available.
"Defense is always just about heart," Bynum said. "You can stop anybody if you really move your feet ... A lot of players don't want to do it on a consistent basis."
Overall, retail sales figures for the euro area were a little more encouraging. Sales rose by 0.3% in March from February, compared with expectations for a 0.2% drop. However, most of the pickup was driven by Germany and France. Consumers in Spain and Portugal spent less freely, with sales there down 0.5% and 2.2%, respectively, adding to concerns about the impact of tough austerity measures on the euro-zone's peripheral nations.
Yvonne Castaneda is vice president of Silly Rabbit Confetti Eggs, a San Antonio, Texas, company that sells confetti-filled eggs to regional and national stores, such as Walmart and Walgreens, in the Southwest. The product is inching north, says Castaneda, as the cascarone craze catches on.
Of course, this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, al Qaeda's safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.
Patricia Schuba, the head of LEO, said the group sued as a last resort after challenging the zoning proposal over the past two years.

Plus, Wells Fargo's results got a surprise lift from investment banking gains -- a line of business that hasn't been a major focus for the consumer-oriented bank. The bank's investment banking revenue from commercial customers leaped 20 percent from a year ago, it said.
Which is why Cravaack's proposed elimination of "redundant" climate-change programs is a breathtakingly bad idea. Addressing the effects of the Earth's rapidly metastasizing climate crisis is too important to leave up to any single government program. Rather, it will require an all-out effort involving both public and private-sector organizations at all levels of society -- more redundancy, not less.
What? Oh, the identity chip is implanted in all the zoo animals. It's like a computerized zoological Social Security number, programmed birth date, gender, genealogy, medical history, etc. With a special whiz-bang device that looks like a cross between a grocery store bar-code scanner, a bullhorn and a cop's radar gun, the folks at the zoo can tell in an instant just who it is they're dealing with.

A few weeks ago, soul-weary and anxious for escape, a couple of friends and I trekked to the Outer Richmond for an escape of another kind. Without means to leave town for the day, we did the next best thing -- escape through cuisine.
-- Black men have felt they aren’t portrayed well in these works. Her reaction to that? She is an artist trying to present a unique character, although the circumstances are not unique. Her character Abdul is not a “black everyman,” Sapphire said. People can criticize, she added, and are welcome to create their own characters. But these are her creations.

Tim Trimble will camp out for the weekend and has attended all but two of the festivals. Trimble said there is such a variety and it’s a big event.
I didn't send this case to National because I thought you weren't responsible. When I read the email chain between you and the company, I felt the representative with whom you were communicating was being short and dismissive. If nothing else, I felt National owed you a more thorough explanation of why you were liable. Instead, it sent you one-sentence replies. That's not good customer service.
The aide said Edwards then directed him to use the money from Mellon to provide a monthly allowance to Hunter of between $5,000 and $12,000.

øBehind Caro's spartan desk, on typed pages tacked to a cork board, is the outline for the fifth Johnson volume. In part, it will detail the law that has had so much impact on Obama and the rest of the country: the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
As for the point situation, Loyd made significant strides during the CBI Tournament and would be in line to start after making 16 starts in his freshman season. Sim, a combo guard, hardly played the point at all in 2010-11. Barron is a physical point guard, and Kingma is another combo whose shooting overshadows his playmaking abilities.
Moore said the presence of plastic in the ocean is concerning for a variety of reasons. His foundation has discovered that reef-like structures are forming on the plastic, with crabs, sea anemones, barnacles and even coral heads living on the plastic jetsam floating in the ocean. These reefs alter the deep ocean by blocking sunlight and alter the ocean's chemistry.

Crude and gasoline futures slid again Friday.
øThe team's leaky defensive play was going on late in the regular- season. The sign we missed: the Penguins weren't winning games as much as they were just outscoring opponents. There is a distinction there, and it shows up in the playoffs.
It's the subject of his newest book, "Making a Difference: Stories of Vision and Courage from America's Leaders," and the cornerstone of his purpose as an aviation expert and public speaker.
When the rain finally subsided, the fans moved back to their seats, and the Red Sox took the field for the bottom of the seventh. Behind them, the out-of-town scoreboard revealed that the Rays had tied the Yankees, 7-7, in the bottom of the ninth. Still, by the time the renowned Red Sox closer, Jonathan Papelbon, took the mound for the ninth inning, and promptly struck out the first two batters, Boston needed only one out to clinch at least a tie with Tampa, and a Yankee extra-inning victory would send them to the playoffs. It seemed inevitable, after all, that they would finally dispatch the Orioles to ponder their 14th straight losing season. Indeed, they were 77-0 this season when leading after eight innings.
He claimed that this was not the first time the district filed a court order against him.

The Assembly recently passed AB 1585, which recognizes responsible RDA use and repairs some of the damage done to a few cities that have been unfairly and seriously harmed by the state's actions, like Sunnyvale and Morgan Hill. It will restore about $40 million of the $134 million still owed to Sunnyvale. Now the Senate must pass AB 1585, and the governor must sign it into law.

In embracing the layman and laywoman, Lewin has become a star not only of YouTube but also of MIT's OpenCourseWare on the Web ("Free lecture notes, exams, and videos from MIT. No registration required."), which presents nearly 100 of his lectures on Newtonian mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and vibrations and waves. These consist largely of engaging and sometimes alarming classroom demonstrations of such fundamental physical principles as the action of a pendulum, which Lewin demonstrates by straddling a steel plumb bob suspended from the ceiling and whizzing back and forth across the room (a photo of him doing this serves as the book's jacket illustration).
While there are some interesting moments and ideas floating around in "Rise," they never seem to come together and there are even a few instances when I was compelled to groan or laugh during some very 'serious" moments.

Topping: This is the practice of cutting the top off a tree or tall cactus, especially if it has grown too tall for the space or is growing under a power line or some other obstacle. Trees whose main leaders and branches are not cut at a junction will send out many sprouts, which are weakly attached. Although the tree receives nutrition to survive, the overall branching structure will be permanently ruined and the tree essentially becomes a large shrub.
Some people might have looked for a big-name rider for the Derby. These people were not going to change a thing.
While unfounded rumors ran throughout the 2011 season that Logan would relieve Brookhart despite the fact the Mustangs had won three titles in succession and extended their winning streak to 34 games, they suddenly gained steam the past two weeks after Logan left Mullen, then Brookhart resigned last week.

William and Kate, as we like to call her, are finally getting married. Brits will get a banker's holiday thanks to the royal couple's choice of a Friday morning wedding date. And the rest of us find ourselves reciting in surprising detail more facts about England's latest fairytale wedding than we may care to acknowledge we know.
But c'mon: Other nations follow "international law" mostly when it suits them. Many that claim immunity are only too eager to subject officials from countries like America and Israel to criminal charges, never mind civil claims. Tell me again why we're protecting them?
A:There were better poker players, but few better hustlers and promoters of the game. And he had countless witticisms. One of my favorites: “The population in Amarillo has stayed the same over the last 50 years — every time some woman gets pregnant, some man leaves town.”
Locke Bowman - an attorney from Northwestern University's MacArthur Justice Center who is representing Koschman's mother, Nanci Koschman, and two other family members - says he was unaware of Toomin's contributions to Alvarez until asked about them by a Chicago Sun-Times reporter.

Matheny put his own stamp on this affair. He put the Cards in motion with hit-and-run calls and got a stolen base from Furcal. He opted not to use pinch-hitters in the seventh for Jon Jay and Descalso, valuing defense over an opportunity to avoid a lefty-lefty matchup at the plate. He rode Lohse into the eighth inning, passing on another pinch-hitting opportunity.

Hodge attributes the loss to Nichol's alleged involvement in a scandal involving a local paving contractor that's currently under investigation by the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office.
Gov. Martin O'Malley has convened a special session this week to redistrict the congressional maps in Maryland. The news out of Annapolis says that we will not see a "jobs bill" or any other bills to bolster Maryland's economy during the session. If true, the failure of Annapolis to act to reignite Maryland's economic engine in this time of malaise should be part of the first sentence of an indictment charging our state legislators with abdicating their responsibilities.

Passing storm: Tipoff's old pal Burt Graeff, the former Plain Dealer Cavs beat writer now spending retirement blissfully stress-free in the desert sun, shot us an email last week after we reported on Brad Sellers' candidacy for Warrensville Heights mayor. It was Sellers, Graeff reminded us, who, while playing for the Chicago Bulls, inbounded the ball to Michael Jordan in a 1989 playoff game against the Cavs. Jordan jumped high over the outstretched hand of Craig Ehlo, and "The Shot" became a part of Cleveland's miserable sports history.
“Guess who answered the ambulance calls?’’ she grimaced from the soreness. “Josh Wymbs — one of the guys helping fix up the store.”
Jimmy Dimora is no Anthony Sowell. But the lame-duck Cuyahoga County commissioner looking down the barrel of 26 corruption charges and the alleged serial killer do have one thing in common: They both want taxpayers to pick up the tab for their defense.

But I didn't recall the wacky 1957 Cornell-Liberty Safety Car. The car was made by Cornell Aeronautial Laboratory in Buffalo, N.Y, and funded by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. It included a steering wheel in the middle of the dashboard and cramped facing seats that replicate a train car. It looked like a clown car from a circus. The prototype was never built.

The nationwide telephone survey of 814 nationwide voters by Public Policy Polling was taken May 5-8, before Trump announced that he won't seek the White House. The poll assumed that President Barack Obama wasn't running and Kucinich (who has also said he won't run for president) improbably snagged the Democratic nomination. Under that scenario, it found Kucinich would top Palin, 43-36, and Trump, 40-36.

But if Baldwin stays inside and lets a security person handle it, nobody would remember that incident from the 1990s.

Still, Barbara Bush could turn out to be right in the end.

And if the answer is "depends on what's ideal for kids," then may I submit that we need to think about a requirement that all foster parents be in a permanent, loving marriage, be under age 40, have a vibrant religious faith, college degrees, and an excellent employment history?

One area where that is starkly clear is with the Medicaid program, the state and federally funded health care plan for people struggling near the poverty line. The Republican budget that passed the House of Representatives would impose steadily larger cuts in federal funding to state Medicaid programs — a 5 percent cut in 2013 and a cut approaching 33 percent by the 10th year. Maryland's Medicaid program would lose billions of federal dollars if those cuts were enacted. This plan would not just cut Medicaid but would fundamentally alter its very structure, turning it into a no-strings-attached "block grant" program. This approach would give governors a blank check for pet initiatives and a license to cut support for seniors and low-income kids.

--General manager Ken Williams has made it a habit of keeping his comments about his team and the players to an almost hush this season, as the Sox were an open book under former manager Ozzie Guillen, and a book that has now closed. Williams was asked about extensions for pre-arbitration players such as Philip Humber and Chris Sale, and he wouldn't even go down that road. "The only thing we are focusing on is our focus," Williams said. "That means keeping distractions of any sort to a minimum. I would consider that right now a distraction."

Range is a touchy subject among EV makers. "The reason I say an 'honest' hundred miles is there has been a tendency in some cases for folks to overestimate their range by calculating it in an advantageous situation, say, 30 mph on a flat surface with no stops," Ryan said. —'Honest' means this is what drivers will actually experience driving it around."

He has been quiet in the last few games, probably for a variety of reasons. Part of it is he hasn't had as many opportunities to make plays as he has in some games. Ball carriers and passes haven't been coming into his territory as much. And part of it may be that he's a little worn down or beat up. I don't know that for a fact, but I'm simply raising it as a possibility. We often don't know how players are feeling, or if they are fighting nagging injuries.

The question will be how much importance was paid to saving this recruiting class at the expense of finding an experienced head coach? Did negotiations with Cristobal and others fall through because of Pernetti's insistence on keeping existing staff for continuity? Once Cristobal declined his offer to coach the Scarlet Knights, Pernetti could have then continued to interview throughout the week in an attempt at finding another coach. Or did the support from High School coaches for Coach Flood and a commitment to the set of core values give Flood an inside track from the start?
Mr. Kirshner’s show allowed audiences to “feel a connection” with bands by discovering what they looked like and how they interacted onstage.

ANSWER: Last year, out of the blue, the governor's office called and asked if I'd be interested in doing the state ornament. A few days later, they called back to say they made a decision, and "it's you." I guess that call was my interview and I didn't know it. This year when his office called, they wanted me to work with a school in Joplin in light of the tornado. They asked if I would mind commuting to Joplin to design the ornament and have it replicated. I said it would be an honor. It was so heartwarming to work with those kids.

Where once it was sugar, today it's wine. The walls of the place must consist of a billion red bricks, all the more amazing because the structure once stood in Utah, where it housed a branch of the Amalgamated Sugar Co. In 1933, however, Amalgamated closed the plant and over the next two years dismantled the facility and shipped it, piece by piece, to California to be reassembled on the banks of the Sacramento River, according to research gathered by the Friends of the Clarksburg Library.

The movie, partly shot last spring in Ann Arbor, is scattered and overlong, and even the inherent likability of stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt doesn't make up for the pervasive sense of strain.

All of these players are expected to be back for the summer. While most are fully confident Greene will back to 100% come August, he was such a tremendous impact player for the defense that there will always be some concern. The only player I worry about is Jefferson. Now entering his fifth and final season, Jefferson was beginning to come along last year. Hopefully an idle offseason won’t cause any conditioning issues as he will need to hit the field running to gain the trust of the new staff. It would have been great to have Johnson get the additional practice, especially with the move to LT (to be discussed later). However, with the talent and athleticism that allowed him to rise up the depth charts he should be able to easily catch up.

Nashville resident Christi Witherspoon favors the measures. Despite her busy schedule as a doctor, she and her husband, Roger, spend as much as three hours each night helping their two young daughters with homework.
"That's a big benefit," Clemens said. "This offense has evolved and it evolved last year when I wasn't there. So there's some subtleties to get caught up on.

The two have left politics after being charged in the massive federal public corruption investigation into the Democratic-controlled county government. Dimora has been charged with 26-corruption-related counts and pleaded not guilty. Russo was charged with 21 counts and accepted a plea agreement last September.

About the Mavericks: Dallas has been one of the most consistent teams this season and is one of the hottest in the Western Conference right now, having won 20 of its last 24 games. Three of those losses were decided by one point. ... Dallas went 11-1 in February, averaging 108.9 points per game and shooting 50.4 percent from the field. ... But the Mavericks have revealed weaknesses lately, suffering three losses in their last five games. ... All have come against Western Conference playoff contenders — the Memphis Grizzlies, the New Orleans Hornets and, most recently, the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers beat the Mavericks 96-91 Saturday, moving within a half-game of second place in the West. ... The key number to beating the Mavericks is 100.

The Mavericks went 4-of-16 from three-point range against the Lakers in Saturday's loss. It snapped a streak of 35 consecutive games with at least six three-pointers made, which was the third-longest single-season streak in NBA history. ... Nowitzki, who ranks 10th in the NBA in scoring, had 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in the loss to the Lakers. It was his 11th double-double this season.

The panel is now wrangling over whether Strickland administration Medicaid officials or outside experts should testify. Rep.

Soviet Russia was known for training generations of impeccable artisans in otherwise lost techniques to repair the devastation wreaked upon her monuments during World War II—Kanevsky is not among them.

After graduation he later lived in Leningrad for about 10 years, during which time he endured a sobering arrest by Soviet authorities for attending a private lecture on the history of Jews in Spain.

Three Wishes Cabernet Sauvignon, California ($2.99, 12.5 percent alcohol): Cabernet's palate was defined for years by the famous Bordeaux wines and had become a giant juicy monster with alcohol levels pushing 14.5 percent. This wine put some reserve back in the bottle. The color is light ruby with a purple hue, and the aroma has crushed red-berry fruit with a touch of earth. The taste is "Cabernet Light," with light tannin structure, good fruit and a pleasant finish. It's unremarkable and not very complex, but it's balanced and shockingly good for the money. It deserves a place at any casual family meal. 86 points.

The cynical explanation for this sudden interest in ethics is that Senator Miller is throwing up a smoke screen to distract attention if, as many expect, Senator Currie is allowed to remain in the legislature with nothing more than a reprimand or censure. But all legislators, even those who think they are untainted by the stain that surrounds Senator Currie, need to take this effort seriously. They will likely be in a position during the next three months to decide whether to ask Marylanders to pay more for the services they receive, and taxpayers are going to be much less willing to accept that if they have any doubt that legislators are trustworthy stewards of the common good.

Beinart quotes former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami telling Democracy Now's Amy Goodman that "If I were a Palestinian, I would have rejected Camp David as well." Yet Ben-Ami said in the same interview that Yasser Arafat "was morally, psychologically, physically incapable of accepting the moral legitimacy of a Jewish state, regardless of its borders or whatever." This goes unquoted. I suspect that's because Beinart found it in The Israel Lobby by political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, which also quotes the first part of Ben-Ami's statement but not the second.

My only addition would be to wish that taxpayers weren't being forced to subsidize such people either through welfare programs, subsidized rent, food stamps, zero income tax payments and even so-called earned income credits.

Heavy competition for jobs is a luxury for employers, especially in a year when they are expected to ramp up hiring. It gives them their pick of applicants and allows them to hold down wages.

Researchers can't pinpoint exactly what makes BFFs so powerful, but they know it happens.

Director and cowriter Joss Whedon pulls off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth) and giving each actor a chance to shine.

Still, "The Avengers" is at its strongest in its quieter, simpler moments. Rated PG-13; sci-fi violence and action, a drug reference. 2 hours, 23 minutes. By Christy Lemire, Associated Press.

The Electric Daisy Carnival coincides with another major musical event: the Bamboozle, New Jersey's homegrown rock, pop, and hip-hop festival. Last year's Bamboozle was held at MetLife Stadium, but this year, the event has relocated to Asbury Park. Superficially, there wouldn't seem to be much overlap between the Bamboozle audience and the Electric Daisy crowd. BUt last year, Bamboozle made a sharp move toward EDM, enlisting several popular deejays to spin and even turning an area of the festival into a mini-rave. Skrillex, the enfant terrible of American electronic music, is headlining the first night in Asbury Park. One thing is for certain: there's going to be a heck of a lot of booming bass in New Jersey on May 18.

The hardships experienced by many young single mothers are compounded for KA, who immigrated to the United States from Somalia. KA's difficulty speaking English has kept her from securing full-time employment. Food stamps and Social Security help her take care of her two preschool-age children, but it is still a struggle to cover even the bare necessities.

Instead, school districts can't move to fire teachers for four months of each year — mid-May to mid-September — and are limited in the evidence they can produce to justify their complaints.

The Blazers would love to woo Gerald Wallace into exercising his one-year player option instead of turning unrestricted free agent in June, but who does the sweet-talking? Crawford is a free agent.

Teenage minds might actually be predisposed to risk-taking. In 2005 and 2006, researchers at Cornell and Stanford conducted risk-reward studies across a range of age groups. The study, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published in The Journal of Neuroscience, measured activity in two areas of the brain — one that triggers impulsive actions and another that reins them in with rationality and caution. Researchers found that when confronted with risky choices, teen brains exhibit twice as much activity in the impulse area as adult brains, while the area that expresses restraint lags behind. It takes until the early 20s for the two areas to reach parity, the study said.

To tell both stories — of first love and coming out — the plot follows Alike from home to school to the local gay social scene just a few bus stops from her Fort Greene, Brooklyn neighborhood. The filmmakers use the details of Alike's day-to-day life to drive the narrative along. At the local high school, she's an A student, a writer whose poetry speaks of butterflies breaking out of cocoons in increasingly expressive terms. She's wary of her classmates, but they seem merely curious to know the answer to the is-she-or-isn't-she a lesbian question.

That fact, combined with feeling as though Wallace did not give the council enough notice of her presentation, caused some frustration from council members. When Wallace was adamant the presentation was just part of her report, accusations of playing politics came from both sides of the aisle.

For Weschler, everything grows out of voice, which is, at heart, a fictionalizing factor: a constructed, and often highly stylized, frame. The narrator -- who is almost always Weschler, or some reflection of him ("My journalism," he gleefully admits, "is first-person journalism, not out of megalomania but out of modesty") -- is the first character, creating meaning out of the maelstrom of raw fact.

The situation is not better for apps aimed at children. On Feb. 16, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report titled "Mobile Apps for Kids: Current Privacy Disclosures Are Disappointing."

Gray, the author of two previous, willfully odd short-story collections, is interested in the horror genre, but it's more akin to the alternately seething and absurd moods of David Lynch and Cronenberg than the plot machinations of Stephen King. In one scene, David thinks that Detective Chico, who questions him to make sense of Franny's death, has a nest inside his mouth, quivering with pills instead of eggs. Another character, David imagines, is harboring an inner ear between her lips.

At the other extreme, just two members in the 120-seat Legislature did not introduce a single sponsored bill in the session: Republican Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, of Orange County, and Mike Gatto, a Burbank Democrat. Gatto joined the Assembly after a special election in June, missing the regular deadline for introducing bills. DeVore, on the other hand, was too busy campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat. Whereas the average Assembly member introduced 32 bills in the session, DeVore introduced only three -- an acknowledgement, he said, of the demands of 360 campaign events that made it impossible for him to be present for hearings that the authors of bills are expected to attend.

That's understandable, because those are the people likely to enjoy it most. Yet while Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of the series, too much of the rest of the film is merely serviceable.

3. The Giant had success stuffing the run in the teams’ first meeting
BECKHAM'S OTHER BIG AT-BAT: He doubled in a run in the third and hit the two-run homer in the seventh. But in the fifth, with two outs and nobody on, he staged a 10-pitch at-bat and singled. That forced Smyly into a 26-pitch inning. He might still have been drained from that when he went out for the sixth because Peavy needed only six pitches to get the Tigers out in the fifth. Then Alexei Ramirez led off the sixth with a line triple to right-center and soon scored the tying run.

He really did want to change the world, especially the minds of kids.
Cameron plans to slow his surgery schedule a bit this summer and go on the road, marketing the hospital and all it has to offer pancreatic cancer patients.
the sounds of the past and somehow strike a balance? That's one of the most important questions. I've always played acoustic music. I've never played anything else. To me, music is a language, obviously, and I've learned the language. That's what I speak. If you play jazz and pick up a horn, you're going to play jazz. That's what is going to come out. I pick up a guitar and I write a song, and it comes out in a certain way. It's like I've studied this music, I've researched this music. This music is in me. So when I write a song, it comes out swingin'.
San Francisco police began arresting students and anti-Wall Street demonstrators who stormed into a downtown Bank of America, sat down and began chanting.

WASHINGTON -- Postal officials, eager to stave off an estimated $7 billion in losses this year, think they can save about $3 billion annually by stopping weekend mail deliveries while still keeping post offices open on Saturdays.
At stake is the fate of Obama's call to expand health care to some 30 million people who lack insurance and to prohibit insurance company practices such as denial of coverage on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions. Almost every American would be affected by the legislation, which would change the ways people receive and pay for health care, from the most routine checkup to the most expensive, lifesaving treatment.
NEW YORK - A man murdered during a business meeting in New York City was a top official in a Florida dietary supplement company that has been the target of thousands of consumer complaints.

The incident comes as the campus continues to grieve the deaths of two students from China who were shot and killed April 11. The officer-involved shooting occurred not more than a block from where a memorial service was held Wednesday evening for the students slain last week.
In this case, the chart didn’t seem critical for the story in question, so The Sun didn’t challenge the housing agency. That made it possible to admire the intricacy of the redaction. And to ponder why someone took the time to do it. After all, in the same stack of documents, the housing authority included a few pages that were sheets of solid black ink. Pity the poor toner cartridge.
Those staying in Bloomington, for example, could head to FARMbloomington and try the Lugar Burger, which has garnered coverage in both Food Network Magazine and The Atlantic.
It claims that "Ferrero misleadingly promotes its Nutella spread as healthy and beneficial to children when it in fact contains dangerous levels of fat and sugar."
The next man in line to close for the Yankees is not going to be perfect. He’s not likely to survive a blown save in his first postseason series in the role, or Game 7 of a World Series, much less a blown save in an ALCS game against the Red Sox.
Several years ago, Longtime Lorain Police Chief Cel Rivera, who in 1993 supervised the investigation told Smith's daughter, Amber Bronish, that he did not believe there was enough evidence against Smith. He said that the prosecutor's office kept pushing for the case. Bronish secretly recorded his comments while she was working with lawyers to find a way to free her mother. Reporters obtained the tapes from another source and published parts of them last year.Lorain County Prosecutor Dennis Will, who inherited the case said his office is reviewing the application and will make whatever response is necessary.

The bill is being opposed by several employer groups. They argue that the legislation would expose them to discrimination penalties if they asked candidates about job history, a vital part of the interview process.
Between 2000 and 2008, Philadelphia added 150,000 residents with bachelor's degrees. Its share of college graduates grew 3 points faster than the nation as a whole. Enrollment is up. So are the number of degrees awarded.
Most overblown issue No. 1: TSA scanners and body searches. No travel issue got more clicks on the Web, hours on talk radio and pages in newspapers than the supposed uprising brewing at Thanksgiving over the new full-body scan detectors and the more invasive body searches for those who opted out. It's a legitimate issue, but the prognosticators who forecast a mass uprising at the airports were operating in an echo chamber. Most people just wanted to get to Grandma's house for Thanksgiving, not start a revolution. We'll see what happens at Christmas.
In 2007, he was elected for a seven-year term in the nonpartisan, largely ceremonial office of president.

On Thursday, Sears Holdings posted a list of 79 stores that included its Kmart stores at 1105 N. Court St. in Medina and at 17625 Chillocothe Rd. in Bainbridge Township, outside Chagrin Falls.
The program, which for the first time would provide widespread taxpayer funding for religious and private education, would not be directly funded by the state. Instead, businesses would contribute to the scholarship fund in exchange for tax credits. By its fifth year, the program could cost the state up to $800 million in lost tax revenue.

A CALPIRG study found that the average California taxpayer in 2011 "would have to shoulder an extra $423 tax burden to make up for corporations and wealthy individuals shifting income to offshore tax havens." Small businesses have to foot an extra bill of more than $2,010 on average. State and local tax revenues are so diminished that college students are fasting to protest huge fee and tuition hikes. Roads and bridges are on "deferred maintenance schedules."
Montoya faces up to life in prison without possibility of parole. He was convicted of first-degree murder, child abuse resulting in death and abuse of a corpse.
On a more personal note, I’m an alum of the University of Colorado in Boulder (Pac-12 allegiance already taken, ya’ll). Fun fact: I once won a watermelon-eating contest and a spaghetti-eating contest.
It's been something of a class reunion lately. Francis Coppola made his first film in 10 years, "Youth Without Youth," a muddled mood-memory fantasia that attempted to recapitulate the handmade approach of his "Rain People" days. Martin Scorsese brought out his Rolling Stones documentary "Shine a Light," which hearkened back to his apprenticeship as editor of rock documentaries such as "Woodstock." Brian De Palma made his Iraqi docu-thingamajig "Redacted," which, in its shape-shifty experimentalism, recalled his earliest, French New Wave-influenced movies such as "The Wedding Party" and "Hi, Mom."
The $50 million capping system package - along with an assortment of tools that were designed to go along with it - was completed in August. BP gave reporters a glimpse on Thursday, before planned maintenance and testing.

The controversy comes just 60 days before the event kicks off and adds to the many woes already plaguing the event's organizing committee, the quasi-public body that is overseeing plans for the 54-nation event. The problems include widespread delays in venue and road construction and rain damage to newly built stadiums.
"No, I would say it is something I wanted to do, something different," Kahne said, addressing the Bristol situation. "I was a little unpleased after California. We are just looking at something for a couple of weeks. We are going to see after Texas. We are going to sit down and decide if that is the direction I want to go or if I feel comfortable with Kole doing it again or what. I'm going to wait. I'm going to do two weeks with someone else and then decide after Texas what I want to do."
Dixon Doll, founder of Doll Capital Management, said his "back of the envelope" estimate is that valley venture capitalists may have stakes in as many as 100 companies strong enough to consider IPOs. He said he is doubtful, however, that 2010 will come remotely close to the performance of 2007, when 86 venture-backed companies nationwide went public.
"When we came up out of the basement, the front of our house was blown away. It was pretty surreal," Mullins said. "When I walked out front, I smelled gas because a tree had blown the gas meter off."
The tunnels are big examples of MSD's quandary in trying to meet federal clean-water standards. If the left one carries stormwater and the middle one carries University City's sewage, it all gets scrambled into a common stew during big storms. (The third, smaller tunnel empties from the Tower Grove area.)
Coyotes players Mike Smith, Shane Doan, Martin Hanzal and Mikkel Boedker visited Chase Field before Wednesday night's game.
Goings was a college student in February 1974 when he and a buddy passed through the area on a road trip to Las Vegas. They beat and robbed a man at a bar at a Bridgeton hotel.

But the Supreme Court — to the delight of a group of media outlets invited into the arguments — shot down the appeals court’s criteria. It said the test is whether there is a connection to news media, if the purpose of the report is to gather or disseminate news and if the information was obtained during professional newsgathering activities.

Because the 6-foot-11 McGhee clogged the lane when Butler had the ball, the Bulldogs opted to take their chances from the outside. Howard hit a pair of 3-pointers, Mack and Shawn Vanzant also scored from beyond the arc, and Butler went 8 for 11 from the field in opening up a 20-14 lead.
More than a decade after restaurateur Ken Stewart opened his "country" Lodge in the rural stretch between Akron and Cleveland, he still draws crowds. Large portions, skillful preparations and often exciting flavors apparently trump downtown prices. KSL offers an appealing menu of solid if standard options -- but the real surprises are on Stewart's extensive list of specials. (On one Friday night, the daily options reached a dizzying 25 to memorize.) With a market price of $59 for the pound-portioned King Crab cocktail, or $69 for the 32-ounce porterhouse, it's very easy to tick up a very stiff tab here. That said, the dishes we sampled were universally delicious. Included were a platter-sized plate of plump, well-crisped calamari big enough for a big entree, and an excellent Oysters Rockefeller lashed with hints of Pernod and pristine oysters practically shimmering with briny flavor. A shellfish saute (extra-large shrimp and scallops, plus manila clams, mussels and a somewhat grainy lobster claw) was done up in a Thai-inspired coconut cream sauce with just enough heat to excite. Though the Lodge's interior is showing signs of wear (and the booths remain too snug for easy comfort), its kitchen has as much vitality as the day it opened.
As an above-ground memorial to the victims nears opening, some renewed objections to a plan to store the unidentified remains behind a subterranean wall at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. The museum is to open next year.

Reporters from all over turned to the BAR, which had the best connections to write the most powerful stories from within the gay community about the impact of their fallen leader. Their stories of the candlelight vigils, and the "White Night" riots after White's 1979 voluntary-manslaughter conviction, were widely read by a mainstream audience.
Sure, there was a chance Washington's softly-softly approach could've persuaded Damascus to relax its embrace of Tehran (which has expanded its influence across the Middle East with Syria's help). Or maybe advanced the Middle East peace process -- perhaps bringing an end to hostilities between neighboring Syria and Israel.
Growth in the snack food industry has been virtually flat in the U.S. for the past two years, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Meanwhile, combined sales in China, Brazil and Russia — three major developing markets — rose 15 percent in 2010 and 11 percent last year to $17 billion. That's half the size of the U.S. market but it's growing.

The show concludes with a charming image of Harlequin and his partner Colombina from the Commedia dell'arte by Giovanni Domenico Ferreti. One of the remarkable aspects of the work is its elaborate gold frame with sculptured cherubs playing musical instruments.

"Particularly in Syria, may there be an end to bloodshed and an immediate commitment to the path of respect, dialogue and reconciliation, as called for by the international community," Benedict said, making Syria the first of several strife-torn countries he mentioned in his traditional "Urbi et Orbi" (Latin for "to the city and to the world") Easter speech.
In reality, neither Cameron nor the multiculturalists have the answer for creating cohesion in modern, diverse, globalized states. Multiculturalists think ethnic cultural continuity will somehow mask the wrenching and sometimes dangerous break with the past that newcomers face. Cameron fantasizes that a reinvigorated, hard-sell approach will make abstract liberal ideals into a tie that binds as tightly as ancient tribal or religious bonds.
The current plan includes keeping the Sojourner philosophy while the two schools are merged, but few concrete details have been drawn. Hickey did note that initial plans seem to lean more toward a "combined program."
The abrupt end calls instantly into focus a fuzzy immediate future for the program, which will lose seven seniors, including five of its seven-man regular rotation.

The unfortunate Joseph Merrick was displayed as the Elephant Man on Whitechapel Road and died after years in residence at the London Hospital on the same thoroughfare. Jack the Ripper stalked victims here and is said to have patronized the Ten Bells pub, still in business at 84 Commercial St. opposite the Old Spitalfields Market.
The park service reports that with the new Pu'o 'O'o eruption, nighttime observers have been able to view "rosy clouds of gas and ash" looking up from the bottom of Chain of Craters Road, while hikers with flashlights and sturdy shoes able to make the 2.5-mile round-trip to Pu'u Huluhulu have seen "a deep orange glow" from the advancing Pu'u 'O'o flows and a "reddish glow" from Kilauea's summit eruption. During the day, visitors throughout the park can marvel at the white smoky plume that's been rising from Kilauea's Halema'uma'u Crater since 2008; more recently, evening spectators at the Jaggar Museum have been treated to a "steady glow" within the crater as well as the new activity at Pu'u 'O'o.

From obscure former senator driving a pickup truck across Iowa, Rick Santorum made a surprising — he calls it miraculous — leap to become the most formidable threat to Mitt Romney's march to the Republican nomination. His shoestring campaign, which ended Tuesday afternoon, was a constant reminder of Romney's trouble connecting with the party's conservative core.
The city's Public Works Department provides trash pickup, but General Services workers repair and maintain city vehicles. If a major snow event eats up overtime for workers repairing plows and salt trucks, that will reduce the amount of money available to keep the trash fleet running optimally, Dick said, thus possibly affecting the trash schedule.
And you know what? Compromise has no place in the kitchen. At the French-influenced Rat’s, which is part of the Grounds for Sculpture, Sbraga’s high standards and wide-ranging palette are evident on the French-influenced menu: The Griggstown quail is accompanied by an apple-beet purée, seared foie gras and Jordan almonds. The butter-braised lobster tail comes in a spiced saffron emulsion, and even the cheeseburger is coddled with sottocenere, a truffle-laced cow’s milk cheese from northern Italy.

The veteran rock guitarist isn’t above indulging in mid-Eighties lite-metal cliché. He still likes to punctuate verses with single, quavering, overdriven high notes. But on Wednesday night, his leads were particularly lyrical: his spotlight moment on “Wanted Dead Or Alive” demonstrated everything Sambora does well. He can still crash into a song like a stallion kicking down a barn door. When he slows down – which, admittedly, isn’t too often – his solos can be melodic, soaring, cathartic.

It's well known, for example, that the lack of good options bitterly divided the president's advisors and that the chief executive immersed himself in the details of the decision that ultimately produced a modified version of the "surge" strategy that the Bush administration used to stabilize — temporarily, at least — Iraq. The Joint Chiefs were similarly split over what to do in Afghanistan, as were the commanders on the ground. What Woodward's signature brand of exhaustive reporting and access to sources — including Obama — and timely documents provide are the voices and detailed anecdotes that put flesh on the people in the White House — right down to the name-calling and back-biting.

Mixed couples - where one partner prefers red wine and the other partner favors white - are facing the "what color do we choose" dilemma as Valentine's Day approaches. It can be an expensive source of frustration when having to open two bottles of wine to satisfy both preferences. The better solution is to find a "bridge wine" to achieve harmony. But for the person totally consumed by red wine, is there a white wine with a come-hither appeal? Can a dedicated white wine drinker slide on over to the red side?

Ultimately, the Bears would be wise to seek the input of Cutler, who previously has stressed the importance of continuity for a quarterback. If they don't bring Martz back, the Bears could maintain some continuity by promoting offensive line coach Mike Tice, whom they blocked from interviewing for the Tennessee Titans' offensive-coordinator position last offseason. The Bears, in turn, rewarded Tice with a raise and an extension.

MH: Hopefully. But at the same time, we have different guys pumping at whatever it is, that thing that moves the car down the track. You have to find those guys – we don’t have Darron Thomas, we don’t have LaMichael James or David Paulson. We won’t directly replace those guys, so maybe it’s a combination of two guys or three guys.

It's the same description Jagr used to describe him. That and "unbelievable."

They are working with plans in doing outreach and discussing how the plans can improve outcomes. These are conversations we've never had.

I want each guest to feel like we have experienced something special together, not that they were there purely because we had seats to fill. And the fare is to be no exception.

“If you don’t have any other solution, you have to tackle,” Collin said. “Maybe I was late, but thank god I was able to tackle and win the ball. If I could have made a better play, I wouldn’t have to make the tackle. It’s beautiful. It’s a technical thing for a defender, but it’s a last choice for a defender.”
It won’t work. By trying to conflate Fast and Furious — where some 2,000 weapons were allowed to skate unsupervised across the Mexican border without notifying Mexican authorities — with Bush-era programs such as Operation Wide Receiver (which cooperated with the Mexicans and at least tried to trace the gun-running networks), the Democrats are simply blowing smoke.

Well, I would definitely qualify that as a little bit of a problem. The way I see it, you have two options: You can either man-up and learn to love cats because she loves cats. Or, you ask her to get rid of them. And, honestly, I don’t advise you go with option No. 2. It would be different if you were engaged, because you’d be committed to each other for the long run. But what if she got rid of the cats for you and you two broke up? I bet you’d feel worse than she would!

I never got an explanation for "suspicious driving."

The evolution of Patagonia into a clothing company began in the 1970s, when Chouinard—then a world-class mountain climber and a designer of mountaineering equipment—started importing durable rugby shirts and corduroy knickers for his climber pals to wear. Soon enough, Patagonia was designing its own line of clothes. Soon after that, sales of the clothes far outstripped sales of the climbing gear. This is how Yvon Chouinard became an accidental apparel mogul. This truly hit home when fashion models in New York City started wearing Patagonia fleece vests. He had no idea why, and didn't really care. But he realized his life had changed.

Cities differ markedly in how tightly their borders are drawn around their inner core, and how much of outlying areas are included within city limits can have a big effect on crime levels.

* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason. The Blues have taken 1,898 shifts through four games, most among the 16 postseason teams. That's an average 474.5 shifts per game, the most by any of the 16 postseason teams. San Jose is averaging 435.8 shifts per game. On at least one occasion the Blues caught the Sharks in a long, tiring shift and it played a role in B.J.

They were both 14 at the time of the crimes. Both were convicted of first-degree murders and sentenced as adults. Now, at 15, they stood condemned to die behind bars.
David M. took that even further.
I thought the Browns conveyed the wrong message at the Mike Holmgren-Tom Heckert season-ending press conference. They were defensive, albeit less so than previously, about their long-range plan. They exuded no excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead with multiple first-round picks. They failed to generate any excitement about the prospect of immediately bolstering the offense through the draft and free agency. It was almost as if they were perplexed, if not overwhelmed, by the task at hand.
That is the heart of a matter involving five unslated candidates for office who are asking the Marion Circuit Court to grant them access to the county's voter registration database.
I met a man ... a very special man, an honorable man ... in what is becoming an all-too-familiar way, yet still considered unorthodox by many: through the Internet.
One more piece awaits, Otis. You will have to have your mojo working again, and this time it may be more challenging than dumping those bloated contracts. Trading smalls for bigs is never easy.
Maki offers many dishes that could please both Japanese customers and others. There are the dishes typical of most Japanese and sushi restaurants, but also some usually found at home. The udon is gooey, but not unpleasantly so. It adds an okra-like slick to the broth, coating the thin, slippery noodles. The broth is delicately seasoned -- just enough to let the other ingredients play out their roles.
But the Lions (21-6) lost in the Class 3 quarterfinals against Elsberry a year ago and this winter were defeated in the sectional round by Lutheran North, which would go on to finish third.
"You understand this has nothing to do with love," he told jurors, referring to comments the defense had made about the couple's relationship. "Absolutely nothing. The question is not whether he wanted his wife back, we all know that, the question was what was he willing to do to accomplish that and what was he willing to do when she said no."

“It was a great connection. Coaches were great, they were straight forward,” he said. “They told me early minutes were available, but I have to come in and work for them. I like that. I don’t want anything handed to me.”
There may sometimes be validity to this argument. An officer, for example, who shoots a gang member could be targeted for retribution. On the other hand, on the streets, crooks and cops are not strangers to one another. No officer's identity is a perfectly kept secret, which is why many officers take steps to keep their names and addresses out of public records.

Take, for example, the issue of equal pay. The first legislation that Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which reversed a 2007 Supreme Court decision that made it harder for women to bring lawsuits about pay discrimination. (The court said that Ledbetter had waited too long to complain that she had consistently received smaller raises than her male counterparts, even though she hadn't known of the pay disparity.)

The portions are just right to leave room for some of the best desserts in the city, thanks to pastry chefs Emily Luccheti and Terri Wu. The menu description of "Eatwell Farm's Whole Wheat Flour Carrot Cake" took me back to the '70s, but it was the best dessert of the night. The crumb was moist and the cream cheese frosting had the right tang. It was served with cream cheese ice cream, a dollop of kumquat marmalade and candied pecans ($10).

No other state has for-profit charters with such little accountability.

Now for the surprise: In all three categories, A, B, and C are descriptions of the same treatment, just framed in different ways. The A descriptions state the benefit in terms of relative risk reduction. The B descriptions state it in terms of absolute risk reduction. And the C descriptions give a measure known as number-needed-to-treat, which is especially useful for thinking about the cumulative impact of side effects. If a thousand people have to face side effects for 10 years to benefit one person, a screening test might not be worth it.
His family said Boatwright was most proud of the landmark laws he helped pass establishing protocols related to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
The Beavers can do better. Riley must know it. I'm surprised his wife and daughter didn't beat me to the message here with a, "We love you, but you can't do this," over dinner. And maybe the coach will wake up sometime before kickoff and realize that he needs to put the program, and the community, and what's best for Masaniai in front of Saturday's short-term goal.
Definitions can get a little blurred, but some common attributes help identify ensemble theaters. They are artist-run, from top to bottom.

The grand jury also noted that CPS has no way of tracking whether a child on its watch is growing properly, a basic indicator of well-being. In one of the most stunning revelations in Amariana's case, The Bee pieced together medical records to determine that she grew 3 inches yet gained only one pound in her last three years of life, most of which she spent in foster care.

I cannot say enough good things about this particular 5.5 percent alcohol giant. Moscato d'Astis in general are fun, exciting, easy and yummy. If you're looking to quaff, sip and slurp with abandon and never encounter a bitter face because of a bad food pairing, this is the wine for you. This wine has effervescence; the bubbles are light and soft, but they're there. The color is a lovely gold and straw yellow. The aromas are of sweet apple, clover honey and a touch of fresh aromatic cooking herbs. The flavor has all the sweetness of the nose with a nice structure of citrus underneath to keep it clean. It can be consumed at Thanksgiving, at a picnic or out of a shoe. Try it, you'll love it. 94 points.

But the Wizards have an odd problem when it comes to Lewis—they don’t have any other players who are making much money. If they cut Lewis, they will have about $18.5 million in salary on their books, and the new CBA will require teams to spend at least 85 percent of the salary cap, or $49.3 million this year. Washington will pay restricted free agent Nick Young, and their three rookies (Jan Vesely, Chris Singleton and Shelvin Mack). If Young gets a contract that starts around $7 million to $8 million, and the rookies make about $5 million combined, the Wizards will still have to figure out how to spend about $18 million to reach the salary floor.

In "The Cry of the Owl," this moment occurs when Jenny, the woman Forester has been watching, sees him and doesn't call the cops or run away. Rather, she invites him in, and they start to talk. His plight calls out to her own inner darkness and need.

The Cowboys have maintained that Romo suffered only a bruised right hand when it nailed Jason Babin’s helmet on his second throw in the loss a week ago yesteray against the Eagles. But the hand was badly swollen, and Romo didn’t return to the game — though it turned out to be meaningless anyway — and it could very well be worse than the Cowboys are letting on. Either way, the injury should have an impact tonight in what will be a chilly night in the Meadowlands. Romo was limited in practice all week and wore a black glove for much of it, though he said he won’t wear a glove tonight. He’ll try to gut through what is sure to be discomfort on every throw, but don’t expect him to air it out like he did against the Giants three weeks ago in Dallas.

Stapleton: This is true they have struggled the past two seasons, but you can not completely blame the offensive line coach. It may seem like I’m being defensive of Coach Flood but the truth of the matter is he has been coaching the same stuff for the last seven years at Rutgers in that period he's had a line which I was apart of that gave up just 8 sacks for the season, he has had 6 linemen make NFL rosters. The new wave of linemen that are coming thru Rutgers are better athletes than me and the ones I played with, but they the players need to learn how to play as ONE unit, something the guys I played with understood and we prided ourselves on being the best and striving to get better!

Haith was chosen Big 12 coach of the year by two organizations. But not by the conference's coaches. In fact, he wasn't even one of the top two.

Sometimes it's hard to believe the sweet and soft-spoken Frenchman holding forth at the press preview is also the couture wild child who created such unabashedly bizarre attire. One wonders what his grandmother would have thought of the fetishistic equestrian domination collection.

By virtue of its size and user base of 800-million-plus people, Facebook is at the heart of the personal data economy. Popular apps can quickly go "viral" there and gain millions of users—but can also flame out just as quickly.

The results of our investigation will unfold in stories that we will publish over the next few months, with the first appearing online today. It is a tragic story of a party that went wrong in a small town in Oklahoma, with eerie similarities to the party in Blaine earlier this year. We went to Oklahoma to illustrate that if synthetic drugs are a problem in such a small, tight-knit community like Konawa, they can create trouble anywhere in Middle America.
The sentencing disputes are a legacy of the crack epidemic of the mid-1980s. Then, Congress set stiff mandatory prison terms based on the amount of the drug in the hands of a seller. One gram of crack cocaine was treated as though it were equal to 100 grams of powder cocaine.

Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. (R-Union) called Adler "passionate, energetic and dedicated."
"'Rock of Ages' has done an incredible job of bridging that gap," says associate director Adam John Hunter, whose job it is to assemble and direct the show's touring companies. "People attracted to our show are people who are familiar with the music of that era, absorbed in it, but are not necessarily regular theatergoers. Then we get subscribers to the theatrical series in town, or who heard it was on Broadway and think, 'Oh, I'll go to that,' even if they're not rock fans. And they'll all leave afterward, surprised that they liked the opposite side of the equation."
He cited training review documents that said Campbell was "fleeing, uncooperative, possibly armed and suicidal," and argued that Frashour acted according to the bureau's Deadly Force policy.

The father of New York gun control was Democratic city pol “Big Tim “Sullivan — a state senator and Tammany Hall crook, a criminal overseer of the gangs of New York.
The presumptive Republican nominee aims to set the nation on a very different course early next year. The general consensus about the social contract has been fairly reliable since the days of the New Deal, but Romney intends to rewrite it. A press secretary for the Republican National Committee recently said Romney and his party would pursue the policies of the Bush administration, "just updated." Democrats rejoiced - it meant they could tell voters Romney would simply represent Bush's third term. But in important ways, they're both wrong. Romney is more extreme. Those quietly hoping that he doesn't mean what he says are making a sucker's bet.

Obama carried Indiana in 2008, partly because of his ties to the populous northwestern part of the state neighboring his hometown of Chicago. Democrats acknowledge it will be difficult to win Indiana again this year. Still, the state could become more hospitable to Obama if the Democrats, believing they have a better chance with Lugar out of the race, spend heavily to compete against Mourdock. The state now is on the Obama team's watch list.
The House of Commons no longer has the power to imprison a nonmember, but it could refer a case to the Metropolitan Police.
The Flyers in particular have been absolutely ravaged by injuries over the last few weeks. All season, really. As of the start of the HBO show, they're missing their two best players, Chris Pronger and Claude Giroux, with either concussions of concussion-like symptoms. The Flyers have been less than truthful with the media about some of these injuries, so it'll be curious to see how much they knew and when they knew it.

Gen. Lloyd Austin, the second highest ranking officer in Army, spoke to the troops Friday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which has come under fire for several high-profile incidents.
It's a noble idea, but most of L.A. is too spread out for such nonsense. Walking around just might work, however, in the 1 percent of Los Angeles that constitutes its historic downtown. It's lonely work for a tourist, as hardly anyone goes to downtown Los Angeles who doesn't have to. Visitors tend to prefer the various fantasylands - the ones of Anaheim, Hollywood or Rodeo Drive.
But it is rarely clear whether Perry is celebrating youthful femininity or mocking it. Sometimes she seemed to revel in the trappings of suburban cupcake Americana, and sometimes she kicked hard at the gingerbread walls of the dollhouse she’d constructed. Surely this reflects the mixed emotions of millions of teenagers, torn between the comforts of childhood and the excitement of grown-up self-definition. But Perry could not, or would not, treat the subject with any gravity whatsoever. Instead, she came across as something of a comedienne who has lucked into a record contract (indeed, the show did have the feel of a big-budget Hollywood comedy that ran on longer than it should have), joking her way through a two-hour concert that careened wildly between sugar rushes and sugar crashes. And like a cupcake, it left a craving for something more substantial.
"It’s creating a whole new pension system," said Sweeney (D-Gloucester). "We’re blowing up the system that exists to create one that’s going to eliminate politics."

According to the calendar it's springtime in Oregon and we wanted to run a "Spring" photo contest; however, that may have to wait until next month. The current weather just isn't cooperating: too much rain, snow and clouds.
Where this book really sings is in these moments, when the kids think Abbott is inspiring them when it is often the other way around, all of it deftly handled by co-writer Brown, whose storytelling skills are evident throughout.
Novak also said in the tournament "if you look past anybody, you're going to get popped," which is how I feel on the New York subway. Anyway, Novak doesn't need to warn his team about complacency. The Wolverines have played hard all season, and they just got drilled by Ohio State in a loss that Tim Hardaway Jr. called "embarrassing."

The two made their first film in high school, a mockumentary that took the filmmakers to Nevada's infamous Area 51 in a jokey attempt to prove long-held conspiracy theories that space aliens live there.

Scherzer's lack of command -- he threw 119 pitches in 4 2/3 innings -- stood in particular contrast to the easy strikes rookie Drew Smyly threw all day Saturday. Smyly, a left-hander, doesn't have the stuff Scherzer does, most notably a late-moving, 97-m.p.h. heater, but he has a liquid delivery that requires little in the way of muscle memory. Scherzer, by contrast, winds up and delivers in a violent fashion, which is more difficult to duplicate -- think of a golf swing with too many moving parts.

"Intruders" comes from a very personal side. It is based on some very disturbing thoughts that I had when I was a kid, especially connected to my family environment.
